  You need to have OpenOffice installed for read "OmegaT developer's guide.odt"

  OmegaT.vpp is "Visual Paradigm for UML"(http://www.visual-paradigm.com) file.
It used only for draw UML diagrams. You don't need to to have "Visual Paradigm
for UML" if you want just to read documentation. All diagrams stored in "OmegaT
developer's guide.odt" as pictures. If you need to edit diagrams, you can use
free "Community Edition" of "Visual Paradigm for UML".

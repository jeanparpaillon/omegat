General changes in 1.4 (summary)
----------------------------------------------------------------------
UI changes:
    Find interface rewritten with enhanced functionality
    Main interface improved
    Font may be selected
    Full localisation support
    Belorussian, French, German, Russian and Spanish l10n
    Ability to jump to the next untranslated segment
New filters:
    XHTML
    Java resource bundles (.properties)
Core changes:
    New Fuzzy Matching algorithm - more matches, lower memory footprint
    Refactored code with more comments
    Windows installer


1.4.4
-------------------------------
Enchancements:

- Easy Help system localization 
  (and Belorussian, French, German, Russian and Spanish l10ns)

- Separate source distribution of OmegaT

- Ability to jump to next not yet translated segment
  by Henry Pijffers

- Increased number of fuzzy matches 
  (now with as low as 40% similarity)
  
- Refactoring HTML and XML file handlers
  to improve speed and stability
  
- Some refactorings of file handlers
  to streamline the development of new file handlers
  (will be useful in the future, I hope)

- Glossary now supports UTF-8
  (glossary file should be tab-delimited,
   if extension is .tab - it's in default system encoding,
   is .utf8 - it's in UTF-8 encoding)
   itherwise the file is ignored

Bugfixes:

- Too little fuzzy matches were found,
  especially in small projects

- Old Fuzzy Matching engine was totally
  bad on Japanese source files

- HTML Encoding wasn't always recognized correctly

- And sometimes encoding meta was not inserted 
  into compiled HTML files

- Help file viewer was shown multiple times
  by Sacha Chua

- Empty segments were uselessly displayed

- Font Change now works reliably


1.4.3
-------------------------------
Bugfix release:

- Fixed Bad Segmentation of some files,
  as documented in: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/OmegaT/message/672

- (minor) .properties file handler had off-by-one error when
  parsing Unicode symbols of a form \uXXXX.

Enchancements:
- Created an independent tool to import existing translations 
  of .properties files

- Added "Join mailing list" to Windows menu

1.4.2
-------------------------------
A lot of enhancements:

- Installer and Native .exe launcher for Win32 platform:
    Install script was created by Samuel Murray
    Launcher created using JSmooth.SF.net project

- OmegaT code was refactored:
  1) Each class now resides in a separate file
  2) Classes are structured to packages according to their function
  3) Unused, commented-out and debug code was cleaned out

- OmegaT backs up it's main TMX file after successfully opening it
  (backup has the name project_save.tmx.bak)

- OmegaT is fully localizable now:
  All localizable strings are moved to resource bundle

- New filter: Java ResourceBundles (.properties files)

  !!! Now you're able to localize OmegaT using OmegaT itself !!!
  - create an empty project for your language, 
  - copy source/org/omegat/Bundle.properties into project's 'source' dir
  - open the project, translate it and compile
  - send us the Bundle_XX.properties from project's 'target' dir

One MAJOR bug fixed:
- Cannot insert \n (newline) into localized text

1.4.1
-------------------------------
Match window now displays only fuzzy matches that have a translation.
Benefits:
- fuzzy matches of very similiar phrases without translation 
  don't garbage the screen estate
- in early times of project (when there's not a lot of strings translated), 
  less similiar phrases may be found

and 6 minor bugs fixed:
- Match window contains 6 matches sometimes
- Ctrl-N goes to previous segment
- Sometimes all the text in match window is bold
- Wrong message template: "found {1} glossary term(s)"
- Going to segment without matches may throw Exception
- Status label disappears someties

1.3.16
-------------------------------
Fixed a bug in the file copy routine which would append extra data onto

                SHIFT-ENTER to insert soft return
updated help files
removed buggy "goto next untranslated entry" feature

find screen display size before drawing windows
(thanks SIB for implementation of these last parts)

Changes / new features
- New project window that lists all files within a project and hyper-links 
  to them for better navigation
- Added 'Browse' buttons to project creation window for more user friendly 
  selection of non-default project directories (such as to select a directory 
  containing already unpacked source language files)
- New auto-save mechanism.  Currently set to save project automatically 
  every 5 minutes.
- Returned ENTER key to it's original use of commiting current entry and

- Fixed an intermittent deadlock bug for JRE 1.4

HTML will sometimes (somehow) cause a string of exceptions to arise and
eventually freeze the application.

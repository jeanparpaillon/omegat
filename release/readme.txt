General Notes:

OmegaT 1.4.x requires that the Java runtime environment version 1.4 or
higher be installed on your system. JRE is available from http://java.com.
Documentation on installing and using java is also available there.

After installing java modify your system path variable so that it 
includes the directory where the 'java' application resides.

To run OmegaT from a terminal or DOS window, change to the install directory
(i.e. this directory) and for Linux type
  ./OmegaT
or in DOS
  OmegaT.bat

Note: This command is case sensitive on Linux - note the capital 'O' 
and 'T' in OmegaT.

In the event of a system error (as evidenced by a stack dump in the command
line window), please note the error, the top 5 or so lines of the stack
trace and a brief description of how the error occured and forward this info 
to Yahoo! OmegaT group - http://groups.yahoo.com/group/OmegaT/
or file the bug for OmegaT project - http://sourceforge.net/projects/omegat/.

Please see the file 'release_notes.txt' for information specific to this release.

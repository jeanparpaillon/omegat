   http://sf.net/tracker/index.php?func=detail&aid=1176585&group_id=68187&atid=520347

   * Cancel during project creation caused the dialog to appear in weird state
   * Cancel during project load resulted in InterruptedAcception shown to the user

 - Corrupt target OOo files after compiling
   http://sf.net/tracker/index.php?func=detail&aid=1188307&group_id=68187&atid=520347
   (regression in OpenOffice and XHTML due to a massive rewrite of file filters)

 Enchancements:

 - File Filters Redesign 
   http://sf.net/tracker/index.php?func=detail&aid=991526&group_id=68187&atid=520350

   Now mostly all the information about filters is exposed,
   and may be edited by user. Such as:
   * Turning filters on/off
   * Adding/changing extension(s) of each format
   * Setting of the source & target encoding for the filter to use.
   * Setting a pattern of target filename

 - Load filters as plugins
   http://sf.net/tracker/index.php?func=detail&aid=1195957&group_id=68187&atid=520350
   
   OmegaT now may load filter plugins dynamically.
   Filter plugins should be situated in [OmegaT-install-dir]/plugins 
   and should be packed as JAR files with manifest stating:
   * OmegaT-Plugin: true
   and then for each filter in a plugin (each plugin may have more than one filter)
   * Name: the.package.name.TheFilterName
   * OmegaT-Filter: true

 - UI issues: Make menu item names more clear & Change the way we display version
   http://sf.net/tracker/index.php?func=detail&aid=1037633&group_id=68187&atid=520350
   http://sf.net/tracker/index.php?func=detail&aid=1037638&group_id=68187&atid=520350

   http://sf.net/tracker/index.php?func=detail&aid=1073194&group_id=68187&atid=520350

   http://sf.net/tracker/index.php?func=detail&aid=1164377&group_id=68187&atid=520350
   (now OmegaT stores error messages to 'log.txt' file, reset each time you start OmegaT)

 - New filter: NetBeans EDGE Newsletter
   http://sf.net/tracker/index.php?func=detail&aid=1195959&group_id=68187&atid=520350
   (really a small extension of XML filter, useful for a really small number of people.
    this filter is implemented as a plugn).

 - Edit the project directories paths
   http://sourceforge.net/tracker/index.php?func=detail&aid=1202405&group_id=68187&atid=520350

Not yet in Beta3: 
      Finalize documentation and implement some minor Bugfixes / RFEs.


1.4.5 Beta2
-------------------------------
Bugfixes:

- Less than sign causes problems in XHTML & OpenOffice
  (similar to the bugfix in Beta1, but for XML-based filters)
  http://sf.net/tracker/index.php?func=detail&aid=1176585&group_id=68187&atid=520347

Enchancements:

- Now 1.4.5 is fully localizable (no hardcoded English is left).

  http://sf.net/tracker/index.php?func=detail&aid=1109089&group_id=68187&atid=520347

- OmegaT throws error instead of eating BOM (byte order mark)
  http://sf.net/tracker/index.php?func=detail&aid=1107299&group_id=68187&atid=520347


1.4.4.01 
-------------------------------
(1.4.4 "final" contained a serious bug in TXT file handler,
 http://sf.net/tracker/index.php?func=detail&aid=1106314&group_id=68187&atid=520347
 and was released for a couple of days only, hope you don't have it)
-------------------------------
Enchancements:

- Easy Help system localization 
  (and Belorussian, French, German, Russian and Spanish l10ns)

- Separate source distribution of OmegaT

- Ability to jump to next not yet translated segment
  by Henry Pijffers

- Increased number of fuzzy matches 
  (now with as low as 40% similarity)
  
- Refactoring HTML and XML file handlers
  to improve speed and stability
  
- Some refactorings of file handlers
  to streamline the development of new file handlers
  (will be useful in the future, I hope)

- Glossary now supports UTF-8
  (glossary file should be tab-delimited,
   if extension is .tab - it's in default system encoding,
   is .utf8 - it's in UTF-8 encoding)
   itherwise the file is ignored

Bugfixes:

- Too little fuzzy matches were found,
  especially in small projects

- Old Fuzzy Matching engine was totally
  bad on Japanese source files

- HTML Encoding wasn't always recognized correctly

- And sometimes encoding meta was not inserted 
  into compiled HTML files

- Help file viewer was shown multiple times
  by Sacha Chua

- Empty segments were uselessly displayed

- Font Change now works reliably


1.4.3
-------------------------------
Bugfix release:

- Fixed Bad Segmentation of some files,
  as documented in: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/OmegaT/message/672

- (minor) .properties file handler had off-by-one error when
  parsing Unicode symbols of a form \uXXXX.

Enchancements:
- Created an independent tool to import existing translations 
  of .properties files

- Added "Join mailing list" to Windows menu

1.4.2
-------------------------------
A lot of enhancements:

- Installer and Native .exe launcher for Win32 platform:
    Install script was created by Samuel Murray
    Launcher created using JSmooth.SF.net project

- OmegaT code was refactored:
  1) Each class now resides in a separate file
  2) Classes are structured to packages according to their function
  3) Unused, commented-out and debug code was cleaned out

- OmegaT backs up it's main TMX file after successfully opening it
  (backup has the name project_save.tmx.bak)

- OmegaT is fully localizable now:
  All localizable strings are moved to resource bundle

- New filter: Java ResourceBundles (.properties files)

  !!! Now you're able to localize OmegaT using OmegaT itself !!!
  - create an empty project for your language, 
  - copy source/org/omegat/Bundle.properties into project's 'source' dir
  - open the project, translate it and compile
  - send us the Bundle_XX.properties from project's 'target' dir

One MAJOR bug fixed:
- Cannot insert \n (newline) into localized text

1.4.1
-------------------------------
Match window now displays only fuzzy matches that have a translation.
Benefits:
- fuzzy matches of very similiar phrases without translation 
  don't garbage the screen estate
- in early times of project (when there's not a lot of strings translated), 
  less similiar phrases may be found

and 6 minor bugs fixed:
- Match window contains 6 matches sometimes
- Ctrl-N goes to previous segment
- Sometimes all the text in match window is bold
- Wrong message template: "found {1} glossary term(s)"
- Going to segment without matches may throw Exception
- Status label disappears someties

Changes / new features
- New project window that lists all files within a project and hyper-links 
  to them for better navigation
- Added 'Browse' buttons to project creation window for more user friendly 
  selection of non-default project directories (such as to select a directory 
  containing already unpacked source language files)
- New auto-save mechanism.  Currently set to save project automatically 
  every 5 minutes.
- Returned ENTER key to it's original use of commiting current entry and

- Fixed an intermittent deadlock bug for JRE 1.4

Issues

HTML will sometimes (somehow) cause a string of exceptions to arise and
eventually freeze the application.

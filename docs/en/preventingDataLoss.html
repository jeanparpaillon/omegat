  <title>Preventing Data Loss - OmegaT 1.7.3 User Manual</title>
</head>
<body>

  <h1>Preventing data loss</h1>

  <p style="margin-left: 1.00cm">OmegaT is a robust application. However, you should take precautions against data loss when using OmegaT, just as with any other application.</p>

  <p style="margin-left: 1.00cm">When you translate your files, OmegaT stores all your progress in translation memory in the project's <code>/omegat</code> subdirectory. OmegaT also backups
  translation memory to <code>project_save.tmx.YEARMMDDHHNN.bak</code> in the same subdirectory every time when a project is opened or reloaded. <code>YEAR</code> is 4-digit year, <code>MM</code> is
  a month, <code>DD</code> day of the month, <code>HH</code> and <code>NN</code> are hours and minutes when the previous translation memory was saved.</p>

  <p style="margin-left: 1.00cm">To avoid losing important data:</p>

  <ul>
    <li style="margin-bottom: 0cm">Make regular copies of the file <code>/omegat/project_save.tmx</code> to backup media, such as CD or DVD.</li>

    <li style="margin-bottom: 0cm">Until you are familiar with OmegaT, create translated files at regular intervals and check that the translated file contains the latest version of your
    translation.</li>

    <li style="margin-bottom: 0cm">Take particular care when making any changes to the files in <code>/source</code> whilst in the middle of a project. If the source file is modified after you have
    begun translating, OmegaT may be unable to find a segment that you have already translated.</li>

    <li>Get started with the aid of these Help texts. Should you run into problems, post a message in the <a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/omegat">OmegaT user group</a>. Do not hesitate to post
    in the language you feel the most familiar with.</li>

<h1>General hints and tips</h1>
<dl>
	<dt>Microsoft Office files</dt>
	<dd>When handling MS Office files, remember to convert to OpenOffice.org format and place the converted file in <i>/source</i>. Do not, however, place the original MS Office file in <i>/source</i>. If necessary, create a new directory for it such as <i>/original</i>. When the translation is over, convert the files you have in the <i>/target</i> directory back to MS office file format with OpenOffice.org. (To work with OpenOffice.org and StarOffice, see <a href="en_SO.html">Working with OpenOffice.org</a>).</dd>
	<dt>Empty project ? (Microsoft Office files II)</dt>
	<dd>If you have created a new project and copied the files for translation into the <i>/source</i> directory, but OmegaT tells you that the project is empty, then the files are probably MS Word files and you have forgotten to convert them to OpenOffice.org format.</dd>
	<dt>Displaying the layout while you translate</dt>
	<dd>If you feel the need to see the layout of your text whilst you translate, simply keep a copy of the original file open in a word processor in a separate window.</dd>
	<dt>One project at once !</dt>
	<dd>Don't try to create a new project or open an existing project from within an open OmegaT project. This can cause the internal translation memory of the active project to be transferred to the 'new' project.</dd>
	<dt>Can't open translation memory</dt>
	<dd>If you can't open a translation memory sent to you by a colleague or customer, it may be in an unsupported format. If it is a <i>*.tmx</i> file, it is probably a higher level of TMX. OmegaT version 1.4.0 only supports TMX Level 1.</dd>
	<dt>Lost segment...</dt>
	<dd>You may find that after moving to a segment in a different part of a large project, you are unable to locate the segment in which you were working in order to return to it. To enable you to find your place again, enter a marker (such as '###') in the segment, then hit <i>Enter</i> (to confirm the the change to the segment) before moving to a different part of the project. Better still, add the segment number to the marker, since if your segment is one of several identical segments, you may otherwise find when you try to find your place again that your marker is now found in several segments. </dd>
	<dt>Inserting a marker</dt>
	<dd>If you wish to insert a marker in your translation, for example to indicate an unresolved query, don't use '?' or '*'. These characters are used as search wildcards and are therefore impossible to find with <i>Ctrl-F</i>.</dd>

	<LI><P CLASS="western">If you feel the need to see the layout of
	your text whilst you translate, simply keep a copy of the original
	file open in a word processor in a separate window.</P>
	<LI><P CLASS="western">If you have created a new project and copied
	the files for translation into the <I>/source</I> directory, but
	OmegaT tells you that the project is empty, then the files are
	probably MS Word files and you have forgotten to convert them to
	OpenOffice.org format.</P>
	<LI><P CLASS="western" STYLE="font-style: normal">If you can't open
	a translation memory sent to you by a colleague or customer, it may
	be in an unsupported format. If it is a <I>*.tmx</I> file, it is
	probably a higher level of TMX. OmegaT version 1.4.0 only supports
	TMX Level 1.</P>
	<LI><P CLASS="western" STYLE="font-style: normal">Don't try to
	create a new project or open an existing project from within an open
	OmegaT project. This can cause the internal translation memory of
	the active project to be transferred to the 'new' project.</P>
	<LI><P CLASS="western" STYLE="font-style: normal">When handling MS
	Office files, remember to convert to OpenOffice.org format and place
	the converted file in <I>/source</I>. Do not, however, place the
	original MS Office file in <I>/source</I>. If necessary, create a
	new directory for it such as <I>/original</I>. 
	</P>
	<LI><P CLASS="western">You may find that after moving to a segment
	in a different part of a large project, you are unable to locate the
	segment in which you were working in order to return to it. To
	enable you to find your place again, enter a marker (such as '###')
	in the segment, then hit <I>Enter</I> (to confirm the the change to
	the segment) before moving to a different part of the project.
	Better still, add the segment number to the marker, since if your
	segment is one of several identical segments, you may otherwise find
	when you try to find your place again that your marker is now found
	in several segments. 
	</P>
	<LI><P CLASS="western" STYLE="font-style: normal">If you wish to
	insert a marker in your translation, for example to indicate an
	unresolved query, don't use '?' or '*'. These characters are used as
	search wildcards and are therefore impossible to find with <I>Ctrl-F</I>.</P>

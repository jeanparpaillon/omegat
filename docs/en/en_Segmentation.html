<h1>Segmentation</h1>

<p>OmegaT segments texts for translation by the paragraph.</p>
<p>OmegaT presegments the text when the project is opened. You cannot move segment boundaries from within OmegaT. If you suspect that your text might contain manual line breaks in inconvenient places, it is therefore worth editing it before opening the project. If you are confronted with bad segmenting (e.g. a line break in the middle of a sentence) whilst you are working in OmegaT, you can remove the break from the source text (for example in a text editor or word processor). You will not see the change in OmegaT until you reload the project, however.</p>
<p>To use sentence-level segmentation in OmegaT, use the OpenOffice.org conversion macros. These macros convert sentences in OpenOffice.org files to paragraphs so that when the file is opened in OmegaT, it is segmented by the sentence rather than by the paragraph. The macros can be downloaded from the OmegaT web site.</p>

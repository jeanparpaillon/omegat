  <h1>Command line</h1>

  <p class="indent">Normally, it is not necessary to launch OmegaT from the command line. However, the command-line
  method of launching OmegaT enables aspects of the program's behaviour to be controlled by means of modifications.
  There are two ways of launching OmegaT using the command line.</p>

  <h3>Method 1: opening a command-line window</h3>

  <p class="indent">Method 1: Open a command-line window. A command-line window is also referred to as a "terminal
  window" or, on Windows, an "MS-DOS window". The procedure for opening a command-line window on Windows XP is as
  follows:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <p style="margin-bottom: 0cm">Open the Start menu, select "Programs", and then "MS-DOS".</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p style="margin-bottom: 0cm">A window appears containing a black screen, into which you type the actual
      commands.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p>To launch OmegaT, you must normally type two commands. The first of these is:</p>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p class="courier-code-western" style="margin-left: 1cm">cd {folder}</p>

  <p class="indent">where {folder} is the name of the folder, with complete path, in which your OmegaT program -
  specifically, the file OmegaT.jar - is located. In practice, this command will therefore be something like this:</p>

  <p class="courier-code-western" style="margin-left: 1cm">cd C:\Program Files\OmegaT</p>

  <p class="indent">This command changes the folder to the folder containing the executable OmegaT file. The second
  command is the command which actually launches OmegaT. In its most basic form, this command is:</p>

  <p class="courier-code-western" style="margin-left: 1cm">java -jar OmegaT.jar</p>

  <p class="indent">Pay attention to the capitalization - it is important.</p>

  <p class="indent">This method has a particular benefit of being suitable for debugging: if an error occurs during use
  of the program, an error message is output in the terminal (MS-DOS) window which may contain useful information on
  the cause.</p>

  <h3>Method 2: changing the .bat file/launch script</h3>

  <p class="indent">Method 1 is a somewhat impractical way of launching a program routinely. For this reason, the two
  commands described above are contained in a file (a "script", also called a ".bat file" on Windows systems). When
  this file is executed, the commands within it are automatically carried out. Consequently, to make changes to the
  launch command, it is sufficient to modify the file OmegaT.bat. When OmegaT is launched (for example by the user
  clicking on OmegaT.bat), the new commands are then executed.</p>

  <h3>Launch command arguments</h3>

  <p class="indent">The basic command has already been mentioned above. Changes to this command involve the addition of
  "arguments" to it. Arguments are added after the initial "java", and before the "-jar OmegaT.jar" part. A list of
  possible arguments follows.</p>

  <p class="courier-code-western">-Duser.language=XX</p>

  <p class="indent">Normally, i.e. when OmegaT is launched without any arguments, the program first detects the
  language of the user's operating system. If a user interface in this language is available, OmegaT uses it. So, if
  the user's operating system is Russian and OmegaT has been localized in Russian, OmegaT is displayed with a Russian
  user interface, Russian menus, etc. If the language of the user's system is not available, OmegaT defaults to
  English. This is the standard behaviour.</p>

  <p class="indent">The "-Duser.language=XX" argument causes OmegaT to use the language specified rather than the
  language of the user's operating system. "XX" in the command stands for the two-digit code of the desired language.
  To launch OmegaT with a French interface (for example on a Russian operating system), the command would therefore
  be:</p>

  <p class="courier-code-western" style="margin-left: 1cm">java -Duser.language=fr -jar OmegaT.jar</p>

  <p class="courier-code-western">-Duser.country=XX</p>

  <p style="margin-left: 1.06cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">Next to the language, you can also specify the country, for
  example CN or TW in case of the Chinese language. To get the correct Instant start guide, you need to specify both
  the language and the country. This is necessary even if there's only one combination available, like pt_BR in case of
  Portuguese / Brasil. .</p>

  <p style="margin-left: 1.03cm; margin-bottom: 0cm"><br></p>

  <p class="courier-code-western">-Dswing.aatext=true</p>

  <p class="indent">This argument effects anti-aliasing of the fonts, thereby improving their appearance.</p>

  <p class="courier-code-western">-XmxZZM</p>

  <p class="indent">This command assigns more memory to OmegaT. By default, 256 MB are assigned, so there is no
  advantage in assigning less than this figure. "ZZ" stands for the amount of memory assigned, in megabytes. The
  command to launch OmegaT with assignment of 1024 MB (1 gigabyte) of memory is therefore:</p>

  <p class="courier-code-western" style="margin-left: 1cm">java -Xmx1024M -jar OmegaT.jar</p>

  <p class="indent">Arguments can be combined. To launch OmegaT with all the examples described above, the command
  would be:</p>

  <p class="courier-code-western" style="margin-left: 1cm">java -Dswing.aatext=true -Duser.language=pt
  -Duser.country=BR -Xmx1024M -jar OmegaT.jar</p>

<h1>Saving, revising and compiling your translation</h1>
<h2>Saving</h2>
<p>To save your work at any time, Select <i>File</i> &gt; <i>Save</i>, or simply hit <i>Ctrl+S</i>.</p>
<p>This saves your translation not as a document, but as an intermediate translation memory, in the file <i>/omegat/project_save.tmx</i>. .</p>

<h2>Revising</h2>
<p>To revise your text by comparing your translation against the original, simply walk through it segment by segment with <i>Enter</i>. Translators familiar with other translation memory applications will appreciate this convenient method of revising drafts.</p>
<h2>Compiling</h2>

<p>Don't be intimidated by the the computerese!</p>

<p>As you translate in OmegaT, you are not overwriting the original text, but producing translations of each paragraph in a separate file. Compiling is simply the process whereby OmegaT replaces the segments in the original text with the translations in this file. It also generates a translation memory in its final, reusable form. You needn't wait until the translation is finished to compile; you can compile as many times as you like.</p>

<h2>Avoiding disasters</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Make regular copies of the file <i>/omegat/project_save.tmx</i>. Add a serial number or the date to the copy, e.g. <i>/omegat/project_save.tmx-01</i> or <i>/omegat/project_save.tmx-04-05-04</i>. This file can also be transferred to other media such as a diskette as a convenient way of making quick backups. When you are translating formatted (StarOffice/OpenOffice.org, XHTML or HTML) files, in particular, you are likely to find that the file <i>project_save.tmx</i> is much smaller than the original or final texts.</li>
	<li>Until you are familiar with OmegaT, compile at regular intervals and check that the compiled file contains the latest version of your translation.</li>
	<li>Take particular care when making any changes to the files in <i>/source</i> whilst in the middle of a project. Sometimes, you will want to make changes to source files, for example to remove hard line breaks from the middle of sentences. However, if the source file is modified after you have begun translating, OmegaT may be unable to find a segment that you have already translated. Always back up either the source file itself, or the whole project, before making any changes to the source file(s).</li>
	<li>Don't try to create a new project or open another project whilst a project is open. Close the open project, and if necessary relaunch OmegaT, before opening another project.</li>
</ul>

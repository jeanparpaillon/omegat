<h1 align="center">Instant Start</h1>

<p><strong>This instant start guide covers only the very basics.  Ideally, all users should read the user manual to familiarise themselves with everything OmegaT has to offer.</strong></p>

<a name="1"></a>
<h2>Briefly, how OmegaT works</h2>

<p>OmegaT consists of three dockable panes:  the edit pane where you will type your translation, the Fuzzy Matches pane where translation memory matches are displayed, and the Glossary pane, where glossary matches are displayed.</p>

<p>OmegaT extracts segments from the source document, displays them in the edit pane for you to translate, and adds your translations to a translation memory.  After the translation is done (or at any time requested by you), OmegaT creates a target document by rebuilding the source document using the segments from the translation memory.</p>

<p>OmegaT organises your translation work into so-called translation projects. For each project, OmegaT creates a set of folders (directories) into which you should copy the source documents, any glossaries and existing translation memories. OmegaT also creates a  folder which will contain the translated documents.</p>

<h2>How to translate using OmegaT</h2>

<a name="2.1"></a>
<h3>Create and open a new project</h3>

<p>Select <strong>Project -&gt; New...</strong> from the menu.</p>

<p>Navigate to the folder where you'd like to save the project files, and type in a name for the translation project.  This name will also be the name of the project folder, and all project files will be stored in that folder.</p>

<p>OmegaT will prompt you to change or accept the project folders to be created.  It will look similar to this picture:</p>

<div align="center"><img src="createproj.png" alt="Create new project" border="0"></div>

<p>You may simply accept the location of the subfolders (in OmegaT called "directories"), but you should make sure that source and target language codes are correct.  Select the language or language-and-country codes from the dropdown-list or type them in by hand.  Make a mental note of the location of the Translated Files subfolder, for this is where target documents will be exported to.</p>

<p>If you want OmegaT to segment by sentence instead of by "paragraph", it's a good idea to double-check the Segmentation Rules.</p>

<p>When you click OK to accept the project setup, OmegaT will prompt you to import source documents.  You can import individual files, but you can also import entire directory trees (with all files in all subfolders).  If you've accidentally imported the wrong documents or too many documents, you can simply remove them from the "source" folder of your OmegaT project.</p>

<p>Remember, OmegaT can only translate OpenDocument files, OpenOffice.org documents, HTML, plaintext and certain other text files.  Other files will be ignored by OmegaT.</p>

<p>Select <strong>Project -&gt; Reload</strong> to view a list of all files to be translated.  OmegaT loads the first file on the project list by default.</p>

<a name="2.2"></a>
<h3>Translate the segments one by one</h3>

<p>For the current segment, OmegaT highlights the source text in green and displays a copy of the source text between two tags &lt;segment 0001&gt; and &lt;end segment&gt;.  Type your translation between the two tags by overwriting the text.</p>

<p>Press "ENTER" to advance to the next segment.</p>

<p>When you press "ENTER", several things happen invisibly:  OmegaT adds the translated segment to the translation memory, and it searches the translation memory and glossary for matches for the untranslated segment.</p>

<p>If the next segment has a fuzzy match from the translation memory, it would be displayed in the Fuzzy Match pane.  If that segment matched any terms in the glossary, it would be displayed in the Glossary pane.</p>

<p>If there is a fuzzy match, you can insert the fuzzy match text into the edit window as follows:</p>

<ul><li>Select the correct fuzzy match using Ctrl+1, Ctrl+2 etc.</li>
<li>Press Ctrl+I to insert it at the cursor's current position, or...</li>
<li>Press Ctrl+R to overwrite the entire current segment by it.</li>
</ul>

<p>If you want OmegaT not to copy the source text into the target field, or if you'd prefer matches with a high fuzzy percentage to be automatically inserted into the target field, you can set these options using <strong>Options -&gt; Editing Behaviour...</strong>.

<h3>Create the target documents</h3>

<p>After the translation is done (or at any time, when you request it), OmegaT can create the target documents by rebuilding the source document using the segments from the translation memory.</p>

<p>To create the target documents, select <strong>Project -&gt; Create Translated Documents</strong> from the menu.  OmegaT will build target versions of all valid documents in the "source" folder of the project, regardless of how much of it is translated.</p>

<p>You can check at any time what the target document currently looks like by simply invoking Create Translated Documents.  You can alter existing translations in your translation project and then recreate the target documents as often as you like.</p>

<p>The translated files can now be found in the project's "target" folder.</p>

<h2>Dealing with tagged text</h2>

<p>In OpenDocument files, OpenOffice.org documents or HTML files, certain words within a sentence often have special formatting of their own.  For example, a sentence may be in italic font but a word in the middle of the sentence might be in bold font.</p>

<p>OmegaT marks up these format changes using special tags, which you must transfer to the translated version of the text.  See the OmegaT User Manual for advanced tag editing.</p>

<a name="3.1"></a>
<h3>An example...</h3>

<p>In these examples we've highlighted the tags in <font COLOR=#ff0000>red</font> to make them easier to see, but in OmegaT they will not be highlighted.</p>

<p><strong>Here is an example of a segment in HTML:</strong></p>

<p><code><font COLOR=#ff0000>&lt;p&gt;</font>A different display font can be selected via the <font COLOR=#ff0000>&lt;b&gt;</font>Display Font<font COLOR=#ff0000>&lt;/b&gt;</font> dialog.  Open it via the <font COLOR=#ff0000>&lt;i&gt;</font>Settings<font COLOR=#ff0000>&lt;/i&gt;</font> &amp;gt; <font COLOR=#ff0000>&lt;i&gt;</font>Display Font...<font COLOR=#ff0000>&lt;/i&gt;</font> menu item.  The font type and size can be changed from the dialog.<font COLOR=#ff0000>&lt;/p&gt;</font></code></p>

<p><strong>Here is how OmegaT will display it, highlighted in red:</strong></p>

<p><code>A different display font can be selected via the <font COLOR=#ff0000>&lt;b0&gt;</font>Display Font<font COLOR=#ff0000>&lt;/b0&gt;</font> dialog.  Open it via the <font COLOR=#ff0000>&lt;i0&gt;</font>Settings<font COLOR=#ff0000>&lt;/i0&gt;</font> &gt; <font COLOR=#ff0000>&lt;i1&gt;</font>Display Font...<font COLOR=#ff0000>&lt;/i1&gt;</font> menu item.  The font type and size can be changed from the dialog.</code></p>

<p><strong>And here is how you would translate it (this example is in Afrikaans):</strong></p>

<p><code>'n Mens kan 'n ander vertoonfont kies met die <font COLOR=#ff0000>&lt;b0&gt;</font>Vertoonfont<font COLOR=#ff0000>&lt;/b0&gt;</font>-dialoogkassie. Kies <font COLOR=#ff0000>&lt;i0&gt;</font>Opstelling<font COLOR=#ff0000>&lt;/i0&gt;</font> &gt; <font COLOR=#ff0000>&lt;i1&gt;</font>Vertoonfont...<font COLOR=#ff0000>&lt;/i1&gt;</font> op die kieslys. Die lettertipe &eacute;n die lettergrootte kan met di&eacute; dialoogkassie verander word.</code></p>

<p><strong>When OmegaT creates the target document, the HTML will look like this:</strong></p>

<p><code><font COLOR=#ff0000>&lt;p&gt;</font>'n Mens kan 'n ander vertoonfont kies met die <font COLOR=#ff0000>&lt;b&gt;</font>Vertoonfont<font COLOR=#ff0000>&lt;/b&gt;</font>-dialoogkassie. Kies <font COLOR=#ff0000>&lt;i&gt;</font>Opstelling<font COLOR=#ff0000>&lt;/i&gt;</font> &amp;gt; <font COLOR=#ff0000>&lt;i&gt;</font>Vertoonfont...<font COLOR=#ff0000>&lt;/i&gt;</font> op die kieslys. Die lettertipe &eacute;n die lettergrootte kan met di&eacute; dialoogkassie verander word.<font COLOR=#ff0000>&lt;/p&gt;</font></code></p>

<p>OmegaT doesn't automatically detect mistakes in a tagged translation.  Before you deliver the target document to your client, you should check your tags for errors, by selecting <strong>Tools -&gt; Validate Tags</strong> from the menu.  Ideally you should open the document in its associated viewer or editor to double-check the formatting.</p>

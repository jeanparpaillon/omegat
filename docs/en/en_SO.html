<h2>OpenOffice.org and StarOffice: the difference</h2>
<p>OpenOffice.org and StarOffice are, broadly speaking, the same program. OpenOffice.org is open-source, meaning essentially that it is free, and can be copied freely. StarOffice is a commercial product: you must buy a licence for each system on which you intend to use it. StarOffice contains certain components which are not present in OpenOffice.org; purchasing a licence also entitles you to technical support. For the purpose of this manual, all references to OpenOffice.org apply equally to StarOffice.</p>

<h2>OpenOffice.org and OmegaT</h2>
<p>OmegaT is a standalone application. It does not require OpenOffice.org or StarOffice, MS Word, or any other word processor.</p>
<p>OpenOffice.org/StarOffice do however extend OmegaT's functionality considerably, as they enable it to handle files in formats which it does not support directly. In particular, these include MS Word, MS Excel, MS Powerpoint and RTF. To prepare files in these formats for processing in OmegaT, simply open them in OpenOffice.org and save them in the native OpenOffice.org format. When you have finished your translation, open them in OpenOffice.org again and save them in the original format.</p>
<p>OpenOffice.org/StarOffice also add further functionality to the core functions of OmegaT. Spellchecking and sentence-level rather than paragraph-level segmenting are two functions not provided in OmegaT itself but made possible with OpenOffice.org.</p>
<p>Use OpenOffice.org 1.0/StarOffice 6.0 or later in conjunction with OmegaT. Earlier builds/versions (e.g. the OpenOffice.org Beta) may not work. StarOffice 5.2 will certainly <b>not</b> work.</p>

<h2>Hints and tips</h2>
<p>Make sure that MS Word files have not been saved with the &#8220;Fast Save&#8221; option, or OpenOffice.org will probably be unable to read them.</p>
<p>Don't attempt to load OpenOffice.org files saved with the &#8220;Revision&#8221; function (i.e. &#8220;Record changes&#8221;) active into OmegaT. Disable the function and accept all the changes first. This problem is most likely to occur when you receive MS Word files which have been saved with the &#8220;Revision&#8221; function enabled, and you are not aware of the fact. OpenOffice.org supports this function (which is in fact very useful), but it should not be used in conjunction with OmegaT.</p>
<p>Obtain and install the spellcheck tools OpenOffice.org for your target language(s). Then, before loading a project containing OpenOffice.org files for the first time, open these files in OpenOffice.org and change the language of the text to your target language by marking the whole text with <i>Ctrl-A</i>, then <i>Format</i> &gt; <i>Character</i> &gt; <i>Language</i>. You can then use OpenOffice.org to spellcheck your finished translation after compilation. You can change the language after compiling, but if you compile more than once the language will revert to that of the source text file each time.</p>
<p>After compiling an OpenOffice.org-format text for the last time, check that everything has been translated. You will probably want to open the file in OpenOffice.org in any case, in order to spell-check it. You may also find however that OmegaT may miss parts of the text, such as headers and footers.</p>
<p>Should OpenOffice.org fail to open a translated file and return an error, you have probably damaged tags by mistake during the translation process. In this case, open the project again and use the Validate tags function to locate the affected segment(s).</p>

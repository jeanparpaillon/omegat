<h1>Editing functions</h1>
<p>OmegaT's editing functions apply to the editor field, which is the target text of the active segment. Editing operations are restricted to this field, i.e. only the target text of the active segment may be edited at any time. Text in any text field outside the editor field can however be marked and copied for pasting.</p>
<p>OmegaT supports the usual mouse operations, cursor keys and cursor key shortcuts, and shortcuts for mark, cut and paste operations. These are likely to vary between operating systems.</p>
<p>Undo and Redo operations are possible with <i>Ctrl-Z</i> and <i>Ctrl-Y</i> respectively.</p>
<p>You cannot <b>add</b> any formatting to the text you are translating. The formatting of a formatted file (at present, StarOffice/OpenOffice.org and HTML are the supported formats), is retained, and you have a limited degree of control over it. (Refer to <a href="en_Tags.html">Tags</a> for details.) To add formatting, insert a marker such as &quot;##&quot; and format the text in another application such as OpenOffice.org after compiling.</p>

  <p>Glossaries are files that are created and updated manually for use in
  OmegaT.</p>

  <p>If an OmegaT project contains one or more glossaries, any terms in the
  glossary which are also found in the active segment will be automatically
  displayed in the <a href="userInterface.html#Glossary">Glossary
  viewer</a>.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="usage" id="usage"></a>Usage</h2>

  <p>To use an existing glossary, simply place it in the <code>/glossary</code>
  folder after creating the project. OmegaT automatically detects glossary
  files in this folder when a project is opened. Terms in the active segment
  which OmegaT finds in the glossary file(s) are displayed in the Glossary
  pane:</p>

  <p><br>
  <br></p><img src="images/Glossary_pane.png" name="graphics1" alt=
  "Glossary pane" align="left" width="328" height="150" border="0" id=
  "graphics1"><br clear="left">

  <p><br>
  <br></p>

  <p>The glossary function only finds exact matches with the glossary entry
  (i.e. not inflected forms etc.). New terms can be added manually to the
  glossary file(s) during translation (for example in a text editor), but newly
  added terms will not be recognized until the project is reloaded.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="fileformat" id="fileformat"></a>File format</h2>

  <p>Glossary files are simply plain text files containing three-column,
  tab-delimited lists with the source and target terms in the first and second
  columns respectively. The third column can be used for additional
  information.</p>

  <p>Glossary files can be either in system default encoding (in which case the
  files should have the extension <code>.tab</code>) or in UTF-8 (in which
  case, they should have the extension <code>.utf8</code>).</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="howtocreate" id="howtocreate"></a>How to create glossaries</h2>

  <h3><a name="text_editor" id="text_editor"></a>Using a text editor</h3>

  <p>Create a file in your preferred text editor and give it a relevant name
  with the extension <code>.tab</code> like <code>my_glossary.tab</code> for
  example. Type an entry in the source language, then the key <code>tab</code>,
  then the translation in the target language. You can add an optional comment
  after a second <code>tab</code>. Press <code>Enter</code> for a new
  entry.</p>

  <p>When all entries have been entered, Save the document. If the two
  languages do not share a character set then the file has to be saved in the
  UTF-8 encoding. In this case, rename it <code>my_glossary.utf8</code>.</p>

  <p>Hint:&nbsp;in the editor make sure, it does not automatically replace tab
  characters with spaces. The best is to enable the display of special
  characters, so you are sure to have the separating tab characters in the
  file.</p>

  <h3><a name="spreadsheet" id="spreadsheet"></a>Using a spreadsheet
  program</h3>

  <p>For Excel or Calc users this method is quite convenient, since it allows
  sorting, provided you don't need UTF-8.</p>

  <p>Start with an empty sheet. Enter your items,one item per line. Source
  expressions are in the first column, target words in the second; you can
  enter optional comments in the third column. When finished, save the
  document: using File/Save as.</p>

  <p><a name="multiterm" id="multiterm"></a>In File type, select Text (tab
  delimited, or CSV), set the <strong>field delimiter</strong> to
  <strong>tabulation</strong> and the <strong>word separator</strong> to
  nothing (erase anything that is in the field). Use <code>.tab</code> for the
  file extension. The software will ask you a few questions about the format
  loss or the saved sheet but just press OK. Use your file manager to confirm
  the file is properly named <code>my_glossary.tab</code> and not
  <code>my_glossary.tab.csv</code>. Rectify if necessary. Before saving, you
  can select the UTF-8 encoding if necessary. In this case, rename the file
  <code>my_glossary.utf8</code>.</p>

  <h3>Using Trados Multiterm</h3>

  <p>Glossaries created using Trados Multiterm's text export function for
  example can be used as OmegaT glossaries without further modification,
  provided they are given the file extension <code>.tab</code> and the source
  and target term fields are the first two fields respectively. If you export
  using the system option "Tab-delimited export", you will need to delete the
  first 5 columns (Seq. Nr, Date created etc)&nbsp;before the two items of
  interest.</p>

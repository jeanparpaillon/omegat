<h1>Glossaries</h1>

<p>
The glossary function is automatic. To use an existing glossary, simply place it in the
<code>/glossary</code> directory after creating the project. OmegaT automatically detects 
glossary files in this directory when a project is opened. Terms in the active segment 
which OmegaT finds in the glossary file(s) are displayed in the Glossary window.
</p>

<p>
The glossary function only finds exact matches with the glossary entry 
(i.e. not inflected forms etc.).
</p>

<p>
New terms can be added manually to the glossary file(s) during translation (for example 
in a text editor), but newly added terms will not be recognized until the project is reloaded.

<h2>File Format</h2>

<p>
Glossary files are simply plain text files containing three-column, tab-delimited lists 
with the source and target terms in the first and second columns respectively. The third 
column can be used for additional information.
</p>

<p>
Glossary files can be either in system default encoding (in that case, the files should
have <code>.tab</code> extensions) or in UTF-8 (in that case, they should have 
<code>.utf8</code> extensions).
</p>

<p>
For example, glossaries created using Trados Multiterm's text export function can be used as OmegaT 
glossaries without further modification, provided they are given the file extension <code>.tab</code>
and the source and target term fields are the first two fields respectively.

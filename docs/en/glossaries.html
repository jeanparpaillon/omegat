  <h2><span style="background: transparent">Function</span></h2>

  <p class="indent"><span style="background: transparent">For use in OmegaT, glossaries must be created and updated manually. If an OmegaT project contains one or more glossaries, any terms in the
  glossary which are also found in the active segment will be displayed automatically.</span></p>

  <h2><a name="usage" id="usage"></a><span style="background: transparent">Usage</span></h2>

  <p class="indent"><span style="background: transparent">To use an existing glossary, simply place it in the</span> <code><span style="background: transparent">/glossary</span></code><span style=
  "background: transparent">folder after creating the project. OmegaT automatically detects glossary files in this folder when a project is opened. Terms in the active segment which OmegaT finds in
  the glossary file(s) are displayed in the Glossary pane.</span> The glossary function only finds exact matches with the glossary entry (i.e. not inflected forms etc.).</p>

  <p class="indent">New terms can be added manually to the glossary file(s) during translation (for example in a text editor), but newly added terms will not be recognized until the project is
  reloaded.</p>

  <h2><a name="fileformat" id="fileformat"></a>Fi<span style="background: transparent">le format</span></h2>

  <p style="margin-left: 0.9cm"><span style="background: transparent">Glossary files are simply plain text files containing three-column, tab-delimited lists with the source and target terms in the
  first and second columns respectively. The third column can be used for additional information.</span></p>

  <p style="margin-left: 0.9cm"><span style="background: transparent">Glossary files can be either in system default encoding (in which case the files should have the extension</span>
  <code><span style="background: transparent">.tab</span></code><span style="background: transparent">) or in UTF-8 (in which case, they should have the extension</span> <code><span style=
  "background: transparent">.utf8</span></code><span style="background: transparent">).</span></p>

  <p style="margin-left: 0.9cm"><span style="background: transparent">Glossaries created using Trados Multiterm's text export function for example can be used as OmegaT glossaries without further
  modification, provided they are given the file extension</span> <code><span style="background: transparent">.tab</span></code><span style="background: transparent">and the source and target term
  fields are the first two fields respectively.</span></p>

  <h2><a name="howtocreate" id="howtocreate"></a><span style="background: transparent">How to create glossaries manually</span></h2>

  <p class="indent"><b><span style="background: transparent">Using Notepad (under Windows XP)</span></b></p>

  <p class="indent"><span style="background: transparent">In the folder where you want to create the glossary (presumably in <i>ProjectName</i>/glossary), do a right click, then New/Text file.
  Windows creates a new text file. Press F2 to rename it to <i>YourFileName</i>.tab. Double click on this file.</span></p>

  <p class="indent"><span style="background: transparent">Type the entry in source language, then the key Tab, then the entry in target language (you can add an optional comment with a further Tab).
  Press Enter for a new entry. When all entries have been entered, Save the document (File/Save). If the two languages do not use the Windows character set, then the file has to be named
  <i>YourFileName</i>.utf8. To save it as UTF-8, use File/Save as, and choose UTF8 in Encoding.</span></p>

  <p class="indent"><b><span style="background: transparent">Using a spreadsheet program (like Excel or Calc)</span></b></p>

  <p class="indent"><span style="background: transparent">For Excel or Calc users this method is quite convenient, since it allows sorting, provided you don't need UTF-8. Start with an empty sheet.
  Enter your items,one item per line. Source expressions are in the first column, target words in the second; you can enter optional comments in the third column. When finished, save the document:
  using File/Save as, In File type, select Text, delimiter Tabulation. Don't forget to put ".tab" at the end of the filename. The program will complain that multi-sheets cannot be saved under this
  format. Acknowledge the message by pressing OK. One more complaint that some features might be lost: <i>"Do you want to keep this format?</i>" Press Yes. When you quit Excel, it will ask (again)
  whether you want to save. Assuming you just Saved as (as above), you can safely ignore it. Normally, .tab files are automatically assigned to Excel, so each time you want to update the glossary,
  you just have to double-click on it.</span></p>

  <h2><a name="commonglossaryproblems" id="commonglossaryproblems"></a><span style="background: transparent">Common glossary problems</span></h2>

  <p class="indent"><b>Problem:</b> No glossary terms are displayed.</p>

  <p class="indent"><b>Possible causes:</b> No glossary file in the "glossary" folder; glossary file is empty; the glossary file does not have the correct extension (.tab or .utf8); the glossary file
  does not have the correct encoding; there are no terms in the active segment which match any terms in the glossary; one or more of the above problems have been fixed, but the project has not been
  reloaded.</p>

  <p class="indent"><b>Problem:</b> In the glossary pane, some characters are not displayed properly (but the same characters are displayed properly in the Editing pane).</p>

  <p class="indent"><b>Possible causes:</b> The extension does not correspond to the file encoding.</p>

    <h2>Overview</h2>

    <p>
      OmegaT uses a locale standard in its operation. A locale is used to localize 
      the user interface and user documentation. It is also used to set up certain 
      aspects of a translation project and to handle files. This localization makes 
      use of local codes for its implementation.
    </p>
    
    <h2>Language</h2>
    
    
    <h2>Locale</h2>
    
    <p>    
      A locale in OmegaT refers to what most call a 
      
      <i>language</i>. 
      
      This encompasses the system locale of the computing environment, but also 
      involves internal usage within the program specifically aimed at translation
      projects and the processing of files, or documents, themselves at a more 
      general level. As such, it is not exclusively concerned with the natural 
      language text contained within documents; which is considered a separate 
      and integral part contained in a locale. The locale is specified in terms 
      of a locale code.     
    </p>    
    
    <h2>Locales Codes</h2>
    
    <p>
      The locale codes (a.k.a. locale names or locale IDs) are based on locales 
      as implemented in the underlying Java internationization framework. This 
      is basically a language code and a country code, which many people refer 
      to inclusively, but incorrectly, as a 
      
      <i>language code</i>, 
      
      with the requirement that the language code must be lowercase, the country 
      code must be uppercase, and both are connected by an underscore. There also 
      exists an optional variant code which is not defined by any standard and is 
      left up to the application vendor to specify usage of, if any. OmegaT does 
      not use the variant code presently.
    </p>

    <p>  
      A locale code replaces what many still refer to as a
      
      <i>language code</i>
       
      (a form of locale code) that was used in previous versions of OmegaT. Nevertheless,
      it is still possible to use a 
      
      <i>language code</i> 
      
      without any concerns. The reason for using a locale code instead of a 
      
      <i>language code</i> 
      
      to refer to these similar things is because that is what OmegaT is presenting 
      to the user, as well as using internally. In order not to confuse the issue 
      it is better to put these ideas up front so that translators and other language 
      professionals can work in full knowledge of what they are presented with and 
      so that they are given the correct terminology.           
    </p>
    
    <p>
      In practice there is no real confusion in this matter and it is not necessary 
      to be too concerned about locale code versus 
      
      <i>language code</i> 
      
      or any internal details related to locale code usage. The facts have merely 
      been presented to help avoid any possible confusion that may arise.      
    </p>

    <h3>Compatibility</h3>
    
    <p>      
      There is no compatability issue for end users to be concerned with since
      it is possible to use the same locale codes
      
      (<i>language codes</i>)
      
      in OmegaT as are used in TMX or other applications.
    </p>      
    
    <h2>Related Standards</h2>
    
    <h3>Language</h3>

    <p>
      Defined in the RFC 3066 and RFC 1766. In general, uses a two character language 
      and two character country code connected by a hyphen. The type case is not
      important in general, but certain implementation specify a particular case for 
      the combination of language code and country code.
    </p>
    
    <h3>Locale</h3>

    <p>
      Defined in the ANSI C Standard (ISO 9899) and Java Internationalization framework.
      Both use a two character language and two character country code connected by
      an underscore. Language code is lowercase. Country code is uppercase. A
      variant code is also specified, in different ways in each, but not defined. 
      All codes are optional.
    </p>
    
    <h3>Language Codes</h3>
    
    <p>  
      Defined by ISO 639. Part 1 of the standard (639-1) defines two character
      country codes and part 2 (639-2) defines three character codes.
    </p>
    
    <h3>Country Codes</h3>
    
    <p>
      Defined by ISO 3166. Part 1 of the standard (3166-1) defines two character
      country codes and part 2 (3166-2) defines three character codes.
    </p>
    
    <h3>Variant Codes</h3>
    
    <p>
      Not defined by any standards or codes. Implementation and application
      dependent, if at all applicable.

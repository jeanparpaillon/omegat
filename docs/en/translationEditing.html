  <h1>Translation editing</h1>

  <p class="c1">You translate your files by moving from segment to segment, at the same time editing the current segment. When moving between segments, you may wish the editing field were populated
  with the existing translation or with the source text. . In <strong>Options -&gt; Editing Behaviour... O</strong>megaT offers you the following alternatives:</p>

  <ul><ul>
    <li>
      <p class="c2" style="margin-bottom: 0.2cm"><strong>The source text:</strong> you may automatically populate the editing field with the source text. This is pretty useful for the text containing
      many trade marks and other proper nouns you need to leave intact.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p class="c2" style="margin-bottom: 0.2cm"><strong>Leave the segment empty:</strong> OmegaT will leave the editing field blank. This option allows you to enter the translation without the need
      to remove the source text, thus saving you a pair of keystrokes (<code>Ctrl+A</code> and <code>Del</code>).</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p style="margin-bottom: 0.2cm"><strong>Insert the best fuzzy match:</strong> OmegaT will insert the translation of the string most similar to the current source, if it is above the similarity
      threshold you can adjust in this case.</p>
    </li>
  </ul></ul>

  <p class="c1" style="margin-left: 0.93cm; margin-bottom: 0.2cm">Click OK to save the setup.</p>

  <h2 class="c3">Text to store</h2>

  <p class="c1">Documents you need to translate might contain trade marks, names or other proper nouns that have to be the same in translated documents. There are two strategies for segments that
  contain only such invariable text.</p>

  <p class="c1">First, you may decide not to translate such segments, though if you may fail to remember these are invariant and translate them later during the translation review, as OmegaT would
  report these segments as not translated. This is the default.</p>

  <p class="c1">Second, you may tell OmegaT to store the translation even if it's equal to the source text, so that OmegaT remembers you have reviewed the text and decided to translate it the same.
  Go to <strong>Options -&gt; Editing Behaviour...</strong> and tick the flag <strong>Allow translation to be equal to source</strong>.</p>

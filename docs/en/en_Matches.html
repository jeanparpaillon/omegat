<h1>Full and fuzzy matches</h1>

<p>When a segment is opened, OmegaT scans both the current project, and any translation memories in the <i>/tm</i> directory for matches. A 100% match, if found and exactly, line-by-line equal to the translated text, is inserted automatically into the target text field of the active segment (this means, that although &#8220;Hi!&#8221; and &#8220;Hi&#8221; are in fact 100% matches, there will be no automatic insert, as the strings are not the same). Any fuzzy matches are displayed in the Match and Glossary Viewer window.</p>
<p>Up to five full and/or fuzzy matches may be displayed in the Match and Glossary Viewer window. Hit <i>Ctrl+1</i>, to select the first match, <i>Ctrl+2 </i>to select the second, etc. The selected match is displayed in bold. The name of the translation memory file containing the match shown is also displayed (unless the match is part of the current project).</p>
<p>Once a match has been selected, it can be pasted into the active segment. <i>Ctrl-I</i> inserts the match at the cursor position, <i>Ctrl-R</i> substitutes it for the active segment text.</p>
<p>The percentage match indicated OmegaT is of technical interest only. It does not pretend to indicate how much work has already been done for you!</p>
<p>The differences between the active source segment and the fuzzy match are not indicated.</p>

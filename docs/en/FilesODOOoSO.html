<h2 name="" id="">OpenDocument</h2>

<p>OpenDocument is a newer format supported by OmegaT. Unless otherwise specified, mention here of OpenOffice.org refers to the application and not the file format.</p><a name="" />
<h2 name="" id="">OpenOffice.org and StarOffice: Differences</h2>

<p>OpenOffice.org and StarOffice are, broadly speaking, the same program. OpenOffice.org is open-source, which in essence means that it is free and can be copied freely. StarOffice, on the other hand, is a commercial product: a license must be purchased for each system on which it will be used. StarOffice contains certain components which are not present in OpenOffice.org; technical support is also included with the license. For the purpose of this manual, all references to OpenOffice.org apply equally to StarOffice.</p>

<a name="" />
<h2 name="" id="">OpenOffice.org and OmegaT</h2>

<p>OmegaT is a standalone application. It does not require OpenOffice.org, StarOffice, MS Word, or any other wordprocessor.</p>
<p>However, OpenOffice.org and StarOffice considerably extend OmegaT's functionality since they enable it to handle file formats that it does not support directly. These include: MS Word, MS Excel, MS Powerpoint, and RTF. To prepare files in these formats for processing in OmegaT, open them in OpenOffice.org and save them in a native OpenDocument, or OpenOffice.org format. When a translation has been completed, open the translated file and convert it back to the original format by saving it as the appropriate type.</p>
<p>OpenOffice.org/StarOffice also supply further functionality not in the core functions of OmegaT. Spellchecking is one of the functions not provided in OmegaT itself, but made possible by OpenOffice.org. To spellcheck documents install the proper dictionaries for the languages used.</p>
<p>Be sure to use OpenOffice.org 1.0/StarOffice 6.0 or greater in conjunction with OmegaT. These applications support OpenOffice.org 1.x file formats. To use OpenDocument files requires OpenOffice.org 2.0/StarOffice 8.0 or greater, or another OASIS OpenDocument compliant wordprocessor or editor.</p>

<h2 name="" id="">Hints and Tips</h2>

<p>Make sure that MS Word files have not been saved with the 'Fast Save' option, or OpenOffice.org will probably be unable to read them.</p>
<p>Do not attempt to load OpenDocument or OpenOffice.org files that were saved with the 'Revision' function (i.e. 'Record changes') active. Disable this function and accept all the changes first. This problem is most likely to occur when you receive MS Word files which have been saved with the 'Revision' function enabled, and you are not aware of this fact. OpenOffice.org supports this function (which is in fact very useful), but it should not be used in conjunction with OmegaT.</p>
<p>Obtain and install the OpenOffice.org spellchecking tools for the target language(s). Before loading a project containing OpenDocument/OpenOffice.org files for the first time, open these files in OpenOffice.org and change the language of the text to the target language by marking the whole text with <b>&lt;Ctrl-A&gt;</b>, then <b>Format</b> &gt; <b>Character</b> &gt; <b>Language</b>. Use OpenOffice.org to spellcheck the finished translation after compilation. The language can be changed after compiling, but if the project is compiled more than once then the language will revert to that of the source text file each time.</p>
<p>After compiling an OpenDocument/OpenOffice.org format text for the last time, check that everything has been translated. You will probably want to open the file in OpenOffice.org in any case, in order to spell-check it. It may be the case however that OmegaT has missed parts of the text, such as headers and footers.</p>
<p>Please note that when translating formatted (OpenDocument, OpenOffice.org, StarOffice, XHTML, or HTML) files it is likely that <b>project_save.tmx</b> is much smaller than the original or final texts.</p>
<p>Should OpenOffice.org fail to open a translated file and return an error, you have probably damaged tags by mistake during the translation process. In this case, open the project again and use the <b>Validate Tags</b> function to locate the affected segment(s).</p>

<h1>Files to translate</h1>

<p>
With OmegaT you can directly translate a number of file formats. There are basically two types of file format. The <strong>plain text</strong> formats and the <strong>formatted text</strong> formats.

<h3>Plain text files</h3>

<p>
Plain text files contain text only, so their translation is as simple as typing the translation.
</p>

<p>
Currently, OmegaT supports the following plain text formats:
</p>

<ul>
   <li>ASCII text (.txt, etc.)</li>
   <li>Encoded text</li>
   <li>Java resource bundles (.properties)</li>
   <li>PO files (.po)</li>
   <li> INI (key=value) files (.ini)</li>
</ul>

<p>
Such files are not considered as containing more format than "white space" for indentation/alignement purposes.
</p>

<p>
They are usually modified in text editors and it is generally not possible to have such format retain font/color/margin etc information.
</p>

<h3>Formatted text files</h3>

<p>
Formatted text files contain text as well as information such as font type, size, color etc. They are commonly created in word processors or home page editors.
</p>

<p>
Currently, OmegaT support the following formatted text formats:
</p>

<ul>
   <li>OpenOffice.org files</li>
   <li>OpenDocument files</li>
   <li>(X)HTML files</li>
   <li>HTML Help Compiler (HCC) files</li>
   <li>DocBook files</li>
</ul>

<p>
Such file formats are conceived so that they retain formatting information. Such formatting information can be as simple as <strong>this is bold</strong> or as complex as table data with different font size, color, position etc.
</p>

<p>
In most translation jobs it is considered important to have the translated document look similar to the original. OmegaT allows you to do this by marking the characters/words that have a special formatting with easy to manipulate tags.
</p>

<p>
Simplifying the original text formating greatly contributes to reducing the number of tags. Unifying used fonts, font sizes, colors etc should be considered if possible, to simplify the translation and reduce the number of possible tag errors.

    <p>
      An OmegaT project is comprised of a number of files and directories.
    </p>

    <h2>Files</h2>
    
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          <b>log.txt:</b> 
      
          an automatically created log file used to check for errors. Users can
          check this file and report errors and bugs to the users group or development
          team (see
          
          <a href="Important.html">Important Notes</a>
          
          also).
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <b>omegat.project.</b> 
      
          OmegaT automatically creates this file when the project is created. It is
          located in the main project directory. This file can be edited in any 
          text editor to modify some project parameters. Only modify this if you 
          know what you are doing.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <b>&lt;projectname&gt;.tmx</b>.
     
          This is the translation memory exported by the project. It is saved in 
          the main project directory and is automatically updated each time the 
          project is compiled. This translation memory contains all the segments 
          from the last time the project was compiled. Note that it does not import 
          segments from any translation memory files contained in the

          <b>/tm</b> 
     
          directory.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <b>project_save.tmx:</b>
      
          this is a TMX file that is created in
          
          <b>/omegat</b>
          
          when the project is saved for the first time. This serves as the working 
          translation memory for the project. It is possible to merge pre-existing
          TMs (of the same type) into this one.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <b>project_save.tmx.bak:</b>
      
          this is a TMX file that is created in
          
          <b>/omegat</b>
          
          when a project is first reopened. It serves as a backup of 
          
          <b>project_save.tmx:</b>
          
          and is updated each time you reopen a project, before any possible change 
          has taken place to the translation memory for the project.
        </p>
      </li>      
      <li>
        <p>        
          <b>*.tmx</b>
           
          in
          
          <b>/tm</b>: 
          
          translation memory exchange files created previously. These files must 
          be in TMX Level 1 (version 1.1) format.
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p>
          <b>word_counts:</b>
      
          contains two word counts of the complete project: one count including and 
          one count excluding 100% matches (this function is currently disabled; 
          it will be re-enabled in a newer versions of OmegaT)
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          source document files in
                     
          <b>/source</b>
          
          to be imported into the project for translation. Files with other extensions 
          can also be imported if their extensions are mapped to default extensions.
          See
          
          <a href="FilesSourceDoc.html">Source Document Files</a>
          
          and
          
          <a href="FilesFilters.html">File Filters</a>
          
          for information on file types and mappings.          
        </p>        
      </li>      
      <li>
        <p>
          other (unsupported) files in 
      
          <b>/source</b>. 
      
          These are copied unmodified to 
      
          <b>/target</b>
      
          when a project is compiled. This enables, for instance, the inclusion
          of files for a complete web site in
       
          <b>/source</b> 
      
          to be mirrored in 
      
          <b>/target</b>, 
      
          together with any image files (e.g. GIF, JPEG, or PNG images). 
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>      
          translated document files (of the same type as the associated source 
          document files in /source), along with other non-translatable files copied 
          from 
      
          <b>/source</b>

          at compilation.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          glossary files (i.e. 
          
          <b>*.tab</b>, 
          <b>*.utf8</b>
           
          file types) in
          
          <b>/glossary</b>.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Directories</h2>
    
    <ul>    
      <li>
        <p>
          A main project directory. This directory is created when the project is 
          created. It has the name given to it by the user.
        </p>  
      </li>
     
      <li>
        <p>      
          <b>/glossary</b>. 
      
          Contains 
      
          <a href="Glossary.html">glossary</a>
      
          files to be used, if any. The user must place glossary files in this 
          directory before opening a project.
        </p>
      </li>      
      <li>
        <p>      
          <b>/omegat</b>. 
      
          Contains the files
           
          <b>project_save.tmx</b>,
           
          <b>project_save.tmx.bak</b>,
          
          and
          
          <b>word_counts</b>.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>     
          <b>/source</b>. 
     
          Any files to be translated are placed into this directory before opening 
          a project. Any files in this directory and its subdirectories are included 
          in the project for translation, provided that their formats are supported 
          and they have the corresponding file extensions.
        </p>
      </li>      
      <li>
        <p>       
          <b>/target</b>. 
      
          Translated (and non-translatable) files are located in this directory 
          after compilation.
        </p>
      </li>      
      <li>
        <p>      
          <b>/tm</b>. 
      
          Any 
      
          <a href="FilesTMGloss.html">translation memories</a> 
      
          to be used are placed in this directory before loading a project. Note: 
          regardless of whether you use previously made translation memories or not, 
          OmegaT will create 
      
          <b>project_save.tmx</b>,
      
          the working translation memory for the project (located in 
      
          <b>/omegat</b>)
      
          when the project is saved. It also places an exportable translation memory in 
          the main project directory after the project is compiled.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
        
    <h2>Changing the location of project files and directories</h2>

    <p>
      The project directories are created along with the project. By default, 
      they are all grouped under the main project directory. Alternate locations 
      for the directories can be chosen by clicking on the 
      
      <i>Browse...</i> 
      
      button when creating a project. It is then possible to keep translation memories 
      in a particular directory (e.g. as a TM repository) and select this directory 
      when you create a new project rather than having to copy translation memories 
      into a new project's 
      
      <b>/tm</b>
      
      directory.
    </p>
    <p>
      To change the location of directories after a project has been created it
      is necessary to alter a project's accepted structure from its default settings.
      First, ensure that a project is not open. Then move or copy one or more directories 
      or their files to a new location. If only copying is done, delete the original
      directory or directories where it was done from. Upon re-opening the project, 
      OmegaT will detect that some directories are missing, and will present the 
      directory selection dialog again so that new locations can be chosen.

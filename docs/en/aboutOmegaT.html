  OmegaT is a free multi platform Computer Aided Translation tool, with the
  following highlights:

  <h3><a name="tm"></a>Translation memory</h3>

  <p>OmegaT memorizes your translations in a translation memory. At the same
  time it can use memories from previous translations for reference.
  Translation memories can be very useful for a translation with a number of
  repetitions or reasonably similar segments of text. OmegaT uses translation
  memories to remember your previous translations and suggest to you the most
  probable translations for the text you are working on.</p>

  <p>The translation memories can be very useful when a document, that's been
  already translated, needs to be updated. Unchanged sentences will remain as
  translated, and updated sentences will be shown with an older version of the
  same sentence as the most probable translation. Modifications to the original
  document will thus be handled with greater ease. If you are using previously
  created translation memories, for example given to you by translation agency
  or your client, OmegaT will be able to use them as a reference memories.</p>

  <p>OmegaT uses the standard TMX file format to store and access translation
  memories, which guarantees that you can exchange your translation material
  with other CAT applications, supporting this file format.</p>

  <h3><a name="glossary"></a>Terminology management</h3>

  <p>Terminology management is important for translation consistency. OmegaT
  uses glossaries that contain translations of single words or small phrases, a
  sort of simplified bilingual dictionary for a specific domain. OmegaT
  displays the translation of those words that happen to be present in the
  current segment for your reference.</p>

  <h3><a name="process"></a>Translation process</h3>

  <p>Imagine having to translate anything from a single file to a directory
  that contains subdirectories with a number of files in a variety of formats.
  When you let OmegaT know that you need to translate those files it will look
  for the included files it supports according to the file filtering rules,
  recognize the textual parts in them, split the biggest text groups according
  to the segmentation rules and display the segments one by one so that you can
  proceed with the translation. OmegaT will memorize your translations and will
  propose you translation candidates for segments similar to those recorded in
  memory. Once you want to see how the files would look once translated, you
  can create the translated files open them in the appropriate application and
  see what your translation looks like.</p>

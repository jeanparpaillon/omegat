  <h2 style="margin-left: 0.05cm"><a name="OmegaT_Main_Window" id="OmegaT_Main_Window"></a>OmegaT main window</h2>

  <p style="margin-left: 1.03cm">Main window consists of three panes, main menu and a status bar. You can change the position of any pane or even undock it to a separate window by dragging the pane
  by its name. Depending on the pane status, 5 different signs can appear at the top right corner of the pane. Putting the mouse pointer over each sign should display a tool tip</p>

  <p style="margin-left: 1.03cm"><a name="graphics1" id="graphics1"></a><a name="graphics2" id="graphics2"></a><a name="graphics3" id="graphics3"></a><a name="graphics4" id="graphics4"></a><a name=
  "graphics5" id="graphics5"></a> <img src="images/Minimize.gif" name="graphics1" alt="Minimize" align="bottom" width="18" height="18" border="0" id="graphics1"> reduces the pane to show only its
  name at the bottom near the status bar.<br>
  <img src="images/Maximize.gif" name="graphics2" alt="Maximize" align="bottom" width="18" height="18" border="0" id="graphics2"> makes the pane take all the available window space.<br>
  <img src="images/Restore.gif" name="graphics3" alt="Restore" align="bottom" width="18" height="18" border="0" id="graphics3"> puts the pane back where it was before before it was minimized or
  maximized.<br>
  <img src="images/Undock.gif" name="graphics4" alt="Undock" align="bottom" width="18" height="18" border="0" id="graphics4"> detaches the pane from the main window to a separate window of its
  own.<br>
  <img src="images/Dock.gif" name="graphics5" alt="Dock" align="bottom" width="18" height="18" border="0" id="graphics5"> puts the pane back within the main window.</p>

  <p style="margin-left: 1.03cm">It is also possible to put the panes so that they overlap. In this case the panes will display a tab at their top. Clicking on the tab will put the pane on the
  foreground. The separators between the panes can be dragged to resize panes.</p>

  <h3 style="margin-left: 1.03cm">Editor pane</h3>

  <p style="margin-left: 1.03cm">Here you'll type and edit the translation. Editor pane displays the text of the partially translated document: the text already translated is displayed translated,
  and the text not yet translated is displayed in the original language. The displayed text is split into segments, and you may scroll through the document and double-click on any segment to edit it.
  One of the segments is active. It is the only one displayed in two parts: the upper part is in the original language, in bold characters with a green background color, the lower part is the editing
  field, delimited by two markers: the leftmost marker is "&lt;segment nnnn&gt;" where "nnnn" is a number of the segment in the project, the rightmost marker is "&lt;end segment&gt;". You should use
  the upper part as a reference and overwrite or modify the Contents of the editing field to contain the translation.</p>
  <pre style="margin-left: 1.03cm">
This sentence has been translated.
This sentence has been translated too.
<strong>Cette phrase est en train d'&ecirc;tre traduite.</strong>
&lt;segment 0003&gt;[Here you should type: This sentence is being translated]&lt;end segment&gt;
</pre>

  <p style="margin-left: 1.03cm">Depending on the <a href="translationEditing.html">Editing behaviour</a> the editing field for the untranslated segment may be empty, contain the source text or the
  translation of the string most similar to the one you are going to translate.</p>

  <p style="margin-left: 1.03cm">When you move to another segment, the translation is validated and stored. If you want the segment to stay untranslated, simply make the editing field empty by
  removing all the text (select all with <code>Ctrl+A</code> and delete with <code>Del</code>). Depending on the options you set in <a href="translationEditing.html">Editing Behaviour</a> settings,
  OmegaT may remember a translation when it is identical to the source. It is useful for documents that contain trade marks, names or other proper nouns, or parts in a third language that does not
  require translation.</p>

  <p style="margin-left: 1.03cm">See <a href="translationEditing.html">Translation editing</a> for more details.</p>

  <h3 style="margin-left: 1.03cm">Fuzzy matches</h3>

  <p style="margin-left: 1.03cm">Match viewer shows the most similar segments from <a href="translationMemories.html">translation memories</a>, both from project translation memory created while you
  translate your project, and from legacy translation memories you import from your earlier jobs, or you may receive from your client or translation agency. When you move to the next segment, the
  first fuzzy match (the one with the best matching percentage) is automatically selected. You may select another one by <a href="keyboardShortcuts.html">pressing <code>Ctrl+2</code>, <code>3</code>,
  <code>4</code>, or <code>5</code></a>, depending on the number of available matches.</p>

  <p style="margin-left: 1.03cm">To use the <strong>selected</strong> match in your translation, use <code><a href="keyboardShortcuts.html">Ctrl+R</a></code> to replace the target field with that
  match or use <code><a href="keyboardShortcuts.html">Ctrl+I</a></code> to insert it at the cursor position. The matching percentage is roughly calculated by taking the number of common words in the
  matched and the matching segment and dividing by the number of words in the longest of the two. Selected fuzzy match will be highlighted in <strong>bold,</strong>words that are missing from the
  segment you translate will be <strong><font color="#0000FF">blue</font></strong> and word close to blue ones or in positions, different from their original position, will be <strong><font color=
  "#008000">green.</font></strong></p>

  <p style="margin-left: 1.03cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">Consider the segment:</p>
  <pre style="margin-left: 1.03cm">
   <strong>Information about Java &amp; OmegaT</strong>
</pre>

  <p style="margin-left: 1.03cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">The matching segment:</p>
  <pre style="margin-left: 1.03cm">
   <strong>General notes about Java &amp; OmegaT</strong>
</pre>

  <p style="margin-left: 1.03cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">will be colored:</p>
  <pre style="margin-left: 1.03cm">
   <strong><font color="#0000FF">General notes</font></strong><strong> </strong><strong><font color="#008000">about</font></strong><strong> Java &amp; OmegaT</strong>
</pre>

  <p style="margin-left: 1.03cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">and the percentage should be around 3/5=<strong>60%</strong></p>

  <h3 style="margin-left: 1.03cm">Glossary</h3>

  <p style="margin-left: 1.03cm">Glossary pane features terminology translation loaded from <a href="glossaries.html">glossary files</a>. It shows translation of terms found in the current segment,
  but it only shows it for reference purposes, and does not allow to insert or replace the term with its translation. OmegaT also supports multi-word terms, but in a very basic manner: if both words
  of a term are found in current segment, the term is shown. The format for terminology in the Glossary pane is</p>
  <pre style="margin-left: 1.03cm">
   'source term' = 'term translation' 
   General comment about the term, if any
</pre>

  <h3 style="margin-left: 1.03cm">Main menu</h3>

  <p style="margin-left: 1.03cm">Obviously, you can use main menu to access all OmegaT functions. The most often used functions are accessible with <a href="keyboardShortcuts.html">keyboard
  shortcuts</a>, so once you get accustomed to them, there will no longer be any need to browse through the menus while translating. See the <a href="menu.html">Main Menu</a> appendix for a full
  description of all menu's and menu items.</p>

  <h3 style="margin-left: 1.03cm">Status bar</h3>

  <p style="margin-left: 1.03cm">The status bar displays work flow related messages at the bottom of the main window. This bar gives the user feedback messages about specific operations that are in
  progress. It also displays the number of fuzzy and glossary matches for the current segment.</p>

  <h2 style="margin-left: 0.11cm"><a name="Other_windows" id="Other_windows"></a>Other windows</h2>

  <h3 style="margin-left: 1.03cm">Project files</h3>

  <p style="margin-left: 1.03cm">Project Files window lists the project files and displays other project information. It is displayed automatically when OmegaT loads a project. When the project is
  open, you may use <a href="keyboardShortcuts.html"><code>Ctrl+L</code> shortcut</a> in main window to close it when it's visible, or open it when it's hidden. Project Files Window features:</p>

  <ul>
    <li style="margin-left: 1.03cm">the list of all the translatable files in the project. These are the files present in the source files folder, that <a href="fileFormats.html">OmegaT can
    handle</a>. Clicking on any file will open it for translation</li>

    <li style="margin-left: 1.03cm">the number of segments in each file is shown next to file name.</li>

    <li style="margin-left: 1.03cm">the number of unique segments in the whole project.</li>

    <li style="margin-left: 1.03cm">the number of unique segments already translated. It is updated each time you translate a segment.</li>
  </ul>

  <p style="margin-left: 1.03cm">The set of <strong>Unique</strong> segments is computed by taking all the segments and removing all the duplicate segments equal up to letter case ("Run" and "run"
  are thought different).</p>

  <p style="margin-left: 1.03cm">The difference between "Number of segments" and "Number of unique segments" gives you a rough idea of the number of much repetitions in the text. Note however, that
  the numbers do not say how relevant the repetitions are: it could mean relatively long sentences repeated a number of times (very lucky!) or it could describe a table of keywords (not as
  lucky...)</p>

  <p style="margin-left: 1.03cm">It is possible to modify the number of segments/unique segments by modifying the segmentation rules. Such modifications should _never_ take place after you started
  translating the project. See the <a href="segmentation.html">Segmentation rules</a> for more information.</p>

  <p style="margin-left: 1.03cm">You may add source files to the project by clicking on the "Import Source Files..." button. It copies the selected files to the <code>/source</code> directory and
  reloads the project to load the new files.You can also add source files from internet pages, written in MediaWiki, by clicking on "Import from MediaWiki" button and providing the correspoding
  URL.</p>

  <h3 style="margin-left: 1.03cm">Search window</h3>

  <p style="margin-left: 1.03cm">You'll use search window to find specific segments in the project. There can be several search windows open simultaneously. To open a new one, use <code><a href=
  "keyboardShortcuts.html">Ctrl+F</a></code> in main window. The search window consists of a text field for search string or keywords, flags and radio buttons for setting up the search and o a pane
  containing the results of the search.</p>

  <p style="margin-left: 1.03cm">Pressing the search button after entering a string in the search field will display all the segments in the project that include the searched string. As OmegaT
  handles all the equal segments as one entity -- if you change one of them, all the same segments get updated, only the first unique segment is shown. The segments are displayed in order of
  appearance in the project. Translated segments will be displayed with the original text at the top and the translated text at the bottom, non translated segments will be displayed in original text
  only.</p>

  <p style="margin-left: 1.03cm">If the string is found in one of the project files, you may click it to bring it up in the Editor to modify. Then you may switch back to Search window and go to the
  next found segment to modify it too. Such a pattern is useful to do massive terminology updates. There are two types of search available:</p>

  <ul>
    <li style="margin-left: 1.03cm"><b>exact searches</b> look for the specified query string within the current project or in any directory or directory tree.</li>

    <li style="margin-left: 1.03cm"><b>keyword searches</b> examine the current project and return all the segments containing all of the query words, in any order.</li>
  </ul>

  <p style="margin-left: 1cm">Exact search supports the wild card characters * and ?. The '<strong>*'</strong> character matches zero or more characters (the search term '<strong>run*'</strong> would
  match '<strong>run'</strong>, '<strong>runs'</strong>, and '<strong>running'</strong>, for example). The '<strong>?'</strong> character matches exactly one character ('<strong>run?'</strong> would
  match '<strong>runs'</strong> and '<strong>rung'</strong>, for example, but not '<strong>run'</strong> or '<strong>running'</strong>). This operation searches both the source and translation. You
  may also search within any directory, but bear in mind that OmegaT can search only in <a href="fileFormats.html">files it supports</a>.</p>

  <h3 style="margin-left: 1.03cm">Tag validation</h3>

  <p style="margin-left: 1cm">Tag errors are due to one of the following causes:</p>

  <ul>
    <li style="margin-left: 1cm">a tag, present in the source segment, has been erased from the translated segment.</li>

    <li style="margin-left: 1cm">a tag, not present in the source segment, has been inserted by mistake in the translated segment.</li>

    <li style="margin-left: 1cm">the tags order has been modified in the translated segment.</li>
  </ul>

  <p style="margin-left: 1.08cm; margin-bottom: 0cm"><span style="font-weight: medium">The tag validation window detects the tag errors and lists</span> mistakes in formatting of the translated
  documents. To open the window, use <code><a href="keyboardShortcuts.html">Ctrl+T</a></code>. The window features a 3 column table with:</p>

  <ul>
    <li style="margin-left: 1.08cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">a link to the segment</li>

    <li style="margin-left: 1.08cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">contents of the original segment</li>

    <li style="margin-left: 1.08cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">contents of the translated segment</li>
  </ul>

  <p style="margin-left: 1cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">Click on the link to activate the segment in the Editor. Correct the error and press <code><a href="keyboardShortcuts.html">Ctrl+T</a></code> to
  return to the tag validation window to correct other errors.</p>

  <p style="margin-left: 1cm; margin-bottom: 0cm"><span style="font-weight: medium">Tags generally represent some kind of formatting in the original text.</span> <strong><span style=
  "font-weight: medium">Simplifying the original text formating</span></strong> <span style="font-weight: medium">greatly contributes to reducing the number of tags. Unifying used fonts, font sizes,
  colors etc should be considered, if possible, to simplify the translation and reduce the number of possible tag errors. Take a look at the <a href="formattedText.html#Tag_operations">Tag
  operations</a> section to see what can be done with tags. Remember, if tags bother you and formatting is not extremely relevant to the job at hand, removing most of the formatting from the source
  document will greatly ease the translation.</span></p>

  <p style="margin-left: 1.03cm">If you need to see the tags in OmegaT but do not need to retain most of the format in the translated document you are free not to add the tags to the translation. In
  this case <strong>pay extra attention to tag pairs</strong>. If only one tag out of the pair remains, it will corrupt your document's formatting and makes a translated OpenOffice.org document
  invalid or a translated HTML file unreadable. Since tags are included in the text itself, it is possible to use <a href="segmentation.html">Segmentation rules</a> to create segments that include
  less tags. This is an advanced feature and should not be used by beginning users.</p>

  <h3 style="margin-left: 1.03cm">Help browser</h3>

  <p style="margin-left: 1.03cm">The help browser (which displays this manual) can be called by pressing <a href="keyboardShortcuts.html">F1</a> or calling <strong>Help -&gt; User Manual...</strong>
  in <a href="menu.html">main menu</a>. In the window you'll see the manual and two buttons: <strong>Back</strong> and <strong>Contents</strong>. The user manual is an HTML document with links to
  different chapters. Clicking on a link as you would do in a web browser brings the desired page to the front.</p>

  <p style="margin-left: 1.03cm">The user manual is located in <code>doc</code> subfolder under OmegaT installation folder, so you may view, for instance, English documentation, by opening the
  <code>doc/en/index.hmtl</code> file in your browser. This way you will be able to follow external links too, as built-in help browser does not accept external Internet links.</p>

  <h2 style="margin-left: 0.08cm"><a name="Dialogs" id="Dialogs"></a>Dialogs</h2>

  <p style="margin-left: 1.03cm">You'll use the dialogs below to change OmegaT and project settings. All of them are described in separate sections, below we just summarize what they can be used for
  and how you may call them up:</p>

  <ul>
    <li style="margin-left: 1cm; margin-bottom: 0cm"><a href="projectProperties.html">Project properties</a> is used to modify the project folders and languages. You may open it be pressing
    <code><a href="keyboardShortcuts.html">Ctrl+E</a></code> or by calling <strong>Project -&gt; Properties...</strong> from the <a href="menu.html">main menu</a>.</li>

    <li style="margin-left: 1cm; margin-bottom: 0cm"><a href="fontSettings.html">Font settings</a> is a dialog to modify the font OmegaT uses to display source, translation, matches and glossary
    terms. It is called through <strong>Options -&gt; Font...</strong> <a href="menu.html">main menu</a> item.</li>

    <li style="margin-left: 1cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">You may use <a href="fileFilters.html">File filter options</a> to modify the files that should be handled by each of the <a href=
    "fileFormats.html">available filters</a>.</li>

    <li style="margin-left: 1cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">The <a href="segmentation.html">Segmentation settings dialog</a> allows you to change the way your text is segmented into sentences. Note that
    sentence segmentation is enabled/disabled in the <a href="projectProperties.html">Project properties</a> dialog.</li>

    <li style="margin-left: 1cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">The <a href="translationEditing.html">Editing behaviour dialog</a> changes how OmegaT will behave when you iterate between the segments.</li>

<H1 CLASS="western"><B>Getting started - an example project</B></H1>
<P CLASS="western">The procedure here is for the purposes of
explanation; it need not be followed rigidly in practice.</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P CLASS="western">Launch OmegaT. 
	</P>
	<LI><P CLASS="western">Create a new project by selecting <I>File</I>
	&gt; <I>Create New Project</I> from the menu bar. 
	</P>
	<LI><P CLASS="western">A file navigation dialog is displayed. In
	this dialog, select a suitable directory into which to place your
	project. 
	</P>
	<LI><P CLASS="western">In the File name field, enter a name (e.g.
	<I>ABC</I>) for your project, and confirm.</P>
	<LI><P CLASS="western">Another dialog is called up, this time
	indicating the directories for the project. As you can see from the
	dialog, OmegaT is proposing to create a new directory with the name
	you selected (e.g. <I>ABC</I>), and below that a further five
	subdirectories. You can modify the locations of these default
	directories, but for the sake of the example, confirm the defaults.
	(The project files and directories are explained in detail <A HREF="en_FilesDirs.html">here</A>.)</P>
	<LI><P CLASS="western">Enter the language and locale codes for your
	source and target languages, e.g. DE-CH for German (Switzerland),
	EN-UK for English (United Kingdom). The actual codes are not
	particularly important unless you intend to exchange translation
	memories with customers or colleagues, in which case you should be
	careful to follow the standard required (usually ISO).</P>
	<LI><P CLASS="western">OmegaT now creates a main directory (also
	referred to as the "project root directory") with the
	name you selected previously (e.g. <I>ABC</I>). Below the project
	root directory are five subdirectories: <I>/glossary</I>, <I>/source</I>,
	<I>/omegat</I>, <I>/target</I> and <I>/tm</I>. 
	</P>
	<LI><P CLASS="western">Find a file to translate. Save it as a text
	file with the extension <I>*.txt</I>, and place it in <I>/source</I>.
		</P>
	<LI><P CLASS="western">Open the project you have just created with
	<I>File</I> &gt; <I>Open</I>. OmegaT automatically looks in the
	directory you last opened. Your project root directory is displayed
	with the OmegaT icon, indicating that it is a project.</P>
	<LI><P CLASS="western">Open the project by selecting first the
	project directory marked with the icon (double-click or select and
	confirm with "Open"), then the file <I>omegat.project</I>.
	Do not try to open any other file, such as your source text file -
	it won't work!</P>
	<LI><P CLASS="western">OmegaT opens the project, displaying the text
	of your file in the main OmegaT window. 
	</P>
	<LI><P CLASS="western">Place the cursor in the target field of the
	first segment, between the tags &lt;segment 0001&gt; and &lt;end
	segment&gt;. Type in your translation and delete the original text.
	Hit <I>Enter</I> to confirm. 
	</P>
	<LI><P CLASS="western">Repeat this process with each segment until
	you have translated the complete text. 
	</P>
	<LI><P CLASS="western">Now select <I>File</I> &gt; <I>Save</I>, then
	<I>File</I> &gt; <I>Compile</I>. You can then close OmegaT <I>(File</I>
	&gt; <I>Quit</I>)<I>.</I> 
	</P>
	<LI><P CLASS="western">You will find your translated file in the
	directory <I>/target</I>.</P>

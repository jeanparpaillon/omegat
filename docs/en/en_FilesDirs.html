<h1>Project files and directories</h1>

<h2>Summary of project files and directories</h2>

<p>An OmegaT project comprises the following files and directories:</p>
<p>A <i>main project directory</i>. This directory is created when the project is created.<br>It has the name given to it by the user.</p>
<ul><li><i>omegat.project.</i> When the project is created, OmegaT automatically creates this file and places it in this directory. To open a project in OmegaT, you must open its <i>omegat.project</i> file.</li>

<li><i>&lt;projectname&gt;.tmx</i>. This is the translation memory exported by the project. OmegaT creates it automatically and places it in this directory each time you compile the project. Note that this translation memory only contains segments from the project at the time it was last compiled. It does not import segments from any translation memory files in the <i>/tm</i> directory.</li>

<li>Directory <i>/source</i>. Place any files you wish to translate in this directory after creating your project and before opening it. Any files in this directory and subdirectories below it are included in the project for translation, provided their format is supported and they have the corresponding file extension.</li>

<ul><li><i>*.txt</i>,</li>
	<li><i>*.xhtml, *.html</i>,</li>
	<li><i>*.properties</i>,</li>
	<li><i>*.sxw</i></li></ul>

	<p>Files with other extensions can also be imported if their extensions are mapped to the default extensions.</p>
<p>Files in <i>/source</i> which are not imported into the project are transferred unchanged to <i>/target</i> when you compile the project. This enables complete web sites in <i>/source</i> to be mirrored in <i>/target</i>, together with their image files in formats such as GIF or JPEG.</p></li>

<li>Directory <i>/glossary</i>. Place a <a href="en_Gloss.html">glossary</a> which you wish to use in this directory after creating the project.
<ul><li><i>*.tab, *.utf8</i>: glossary files.</li></ul></li>

<li>Directory <i>/omegat</i>. OmegaT automatically places the following files in this directory at creation:</li>

<ul><li><i>project_save.tmx:</i> this file is created when the project is saved for the first time. It is in TMX format and is the working translation memory for the project.</li>

<li><i>word_counts: </i>this file contains two word counts of the complete project: one including and one excluding 100% matches.</li></ul>

<li>Directory <i>/target</i>. OmegaT places the translated files into this directory at compilation.<br>
<ul><li><i>*.txt, *.xhtml, *.html, *.properties, *.sxw</i>: translated files</li>
<li>Non-translated files transferred from <i>/source</i> at compilation</li></ul></li>
<li>Directory <i>/tm</i>. Place any <a href="en_TMFormats.html">translation memories</a> you wish to use in this directory after creating/before loading the project. Note: regardless of whether you use previous memories or not, OmegaT creates a working translation memory for the project, <i>project_save.tmx</i>, in <i>/omegat</i> when the project is saved, and also places an export translation memory in the root directory when the project is compiled.
<ul><li><i>*.tmx</i>: translation memory files created during previous projects. <i>*.tmx</i> files must be in TMX Level 1 format.</li></ul></li>
</ul>

<h2>Changing the location of project files and directories</h2>

<p>The project directories are created when you create a project. By default, they are all grouped under the project root directory, but you can choose alternative locations for them by clicking on the <i>Browse</i> button. You can therefore keep translation memories in a particular directories, for example, and select the desired directory when you create each new project rather than having to copy the translation memory file into the newly created <i>/tm</i> directory.</p>

<p>To change the location of directories retrospectively, i.e. those of an existing project, delete the directory concerned. (Do not do this whilst the project is open.) When the project is next opened, OmegaT detects that some directories are missing, and presents you with the directory selection dialog in which you can select the new locations.</p>

<h2>About this manual</h2>
<p>This manual is a work in progress. For further information about OmegaT, please visit the <a href="http://www.omegat.org">OmegaT home page</a>.

Feedback is welcome!</p>
<p>OmegaT was developed on the Linux platform, and the development/documentation team does not use Windows. Although this documentation is intended for OmegaT users on all platforms, some terminology may therefore be a little unfamiliar. So, when you see the Linux forward slash /, think &#8220;\&#8221;, and do a mental translation to &#8220;folder&#8221;; whenever you read &#8220;directory&#8221;.</p>

<h2>What is translation memory?</h2>
<p>Translation memory is used during the translation of documents from one language to another. It assists you by storing pieces of text in a database (the &#8220;translation memory&#8221;) so that when you next encounter the same piece of text (a &#8220;segment&#8221;), or part of it, you  can see immediately how you translated it in the past. For translation memory to be really useful, you must use it for long enough to build up a database of segments and their corresponding translations.</p>

<h2>What's special about OmegaT?</h2>
<p>There are many translation memory programs on the market. OmegaT's particular features are:</p>
<ul>
	<li>it runs on the Java Runtime Environment, and can therefore be used on a number of platforms, including Windows, Linux, and Mac OS X;</li>
	<li>it is free;</li>
	<li>it is open-source, meaning that users are free to distribute and modify it;</li>
	<li>it is designed with speed in mind, rather than support for complex data formatting and multiple file formats;</li>
	<li>it supports the OpenOffice.org file format directly.</li>
</ul>

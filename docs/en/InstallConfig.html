    <h1 align="center">Installation and Configuration</h1>

    <h2>Installation</h2>

    <p>
      Installation involves three stages: 
    </p>
    
    <ol>
      <li>
        <b>Java Installation</b>
        
        (if not already installed)
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>OmegaT Installation</b>
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>OmegaT Configuration</b>
      
        (UNIX/optional)
      </li> 
    </ol>
    
    <p>
      Java and OmegaT can be installed in any order. Configuration is not essential
      on UNIX based platforms, but it will make launching the application more
      user-friendly for those that require it.
    </p>

    <h3>Java Installation</h3>

    <p>
      The computer being used to run OmegaT must have a
            
      <b>Java Runtime Environment(JRE)</b>
      
      installed on it--<b>IT WILL NOT WORK WITHOUT ONE INSTALLED!</b> 
    </p>  

    <p>
      If uncertain as to whether or not a JRE is installed, install OmegaT first 
      and then test to see if it works (see 
      
      <a href="InstallConfig.html#omegat-install">OmegaT Installation</a>). 
      
      If nothing happens, or error messages are returned, the Java Runtime Environment 
      is almost certainly not installed. In which case, please obtain one and install
      it first. 
    </p>
    
    <p>  
        Please note that JRE is available in the form of both a standalone product 
      
        <b>(J2RE)</b>
       
        or as part of the 
      
        <b>Java Software Developer's Kit(J2SDK)</b>.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Mac users</b>: 
      
      On Mac OS X, a JRE is pre-installed and configured. This is the only platform 
      that does not require the user to install a JRE. Depending upon the OS X 
      version installed, an old JRE version may be the only one available. If OmegaT
      does not work, make sure to run Software Update from the Apple Menu to get 
      the latest JRE available for the OS X version. OmegaT is known to work on 
      OS X from OS X 10.2 to the most recent OS X 10.3.9 update. It has not yet been
      tested on OS X 10.4 but should work too. In case the system has been updated 
      to OS X 10.3.9 and problems occur, be aware that a special update is necessary 
      to make Java application run on this OS X version. Run Software Update and
      install the required package. Earlier versions of OmegaT (namely 0.97) are 
      known to run on the MRJ for Macintosh OS 9. OmegaT version 1.4 or greater 
      will not run on this platform. To run an OmegaT 0.97 version, download the 
      MRJ for Mac OS9 from the
       
      <!--<a href="http://www.apple.com">Apple</a>-->
      
      Apple website at http://www.apple.com. OmegaT 0.97 is an obsolete version 
      and this documentation makes no further reference to it.      
    </p>
    
    <p>
      <b>UNIX users</b>
      
      (includes Linux & Solaris): 
      
      type 
      
      <code>java -version</code> 
      
      at a command prompt in a console or terminal program. The version installed 
      will be returned(if Java is installed as an executeable in your shell path).
    </p>
    
    <p>
      <b>Windows users</b>: 
      
      check which version of JRE, if any, is installed with 
      
      <i>Start(button)/Windows key &gt; Settings &gt; Control Panel</i>.
      
      If a JRE is already installed, a control panel dialog labelled 
      "Java(TM)2 Runtime Environment, Standard Edition 1.x.y_z&#8221; or similar
      (with x, y, z representing some version numbers) will be present. Note that
      OmegaT cannot be used on any version before Windows 98 due to the fact that 
      the JREs available on that platform are not recent enough.
    </p>

    <p>
      For both UNIX and Windows, please note that as of this writing the current 
      Java version is in the 1.5 range (stable version). Please upgrade to a newer
      version if it is not very recent. A J2RE or J2SDK can be downloaded from the 
      links below. They are free (note the license conditions), but the naming conventions 
      may make finding the right version a little confusing. The correct version for 
      a particular platform (Linux, Solaris, Windows, etc.) is mandatory. The download
      size and final installation disk space required for a JRE should be taken into 
      consideration before proceeding. The download sizes are approximately 14 MB 
      and 32 MB, for J2RE and J2SDK, respectively. Required disk space for installation 
      may be as much as 2 to 3 times larger than the downloaded installation file 
      or package.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      1.4.x versions of OmegaT should work with any JRE version from 1.2 upwards. 
      However, it is recommended to have the latest JRE version installed, older 
      versions of Java may not support certain features.
    </p>

    <p>
      As an alternative to J2RE the J2SDK can be installed. The J2SDK developer's 
      kit contains its own copy of J2RE, as well as support for Java software development.
    </p>

    <p>
      UNIX and Windows users can download the Java Runtime Environment from:
    </p>

    <p>
      <!--<a href="http://java.sun.com/getjava/index.html">Sun</a> (all platforms)-->
      Sun (all platforms) at http://java.sun.com/getjava/index.html
    </p>

    <p>
      <!--<a href="http://www.blackdown.org/java-linux.html">Blackdown</a> (Linux)-->
      Blackdown (Linux) at http://www.blackdown.org/java-linux.html
    </p>

    <p>
      Installation instructions for JRE can be found on the website where it is 
      downloaded from or accompanying the downloaded file or package once it has 
      been opened or unarchived.
    </p>

    <h4>Important Notes:</h4>

    <p>
      Sun regularly changes the names of its products--possibly to confuse its 
      customers. So, all JRE above version 1 are known as Java 2, hence the Java 
      Runtime Environment is now J2RE. The Java Runtime Environment is also known 
      as the Java Virtual Machine, or JVM. On Macintosh, it also is known as the 
      MRJ. The developer's kit has been known as the Java Developer's Kit(JDK), 
      Software Developer's Kit(SDK), and now as J2SE, J2EE, and J2ME, according 
      to the version. At least, I think so. But I am among the confused.
    </p>

    <p>
      Other related (or not so related) forms of Java exist:
    </p>
    
    <ul>  
      <li>
        Java for embedded web browser applications (i.e. via plugins); 
      </li>
      <li>
        JavaScript scripting language for webpages (technically unrelated to Java).
      </li>
    </ul>
       
    <p>
      Neither of these forms of Java will enable OmegaT to run.
    </p>

    <h3>OmegaT Installation</h3>

    <h4>All Platforms</h4>

    <p>
      A generic OmegaT archive is available for installation. This version of OmegaT
      works on Linux, Solaris, Mac OS X, and Windows (and possibly others). See
      
      <a href="SystemReqs.html">System Requirements<a> also. Simply extract the contents
      of the archive into a directory. The archive may be in *.zip, *.tgz, or *.tar.bz2
      form. UNIX and Mac (Stuffit) users should have no problem with most of these
      formats; Windows users may not necessarily have a utility for the latter
      two (recent WinZip versions will probably work with or .tgz file formats; 
      other file compression programs may work also). For more platform specific
      packages see the relevant sections.
    </p>

    <h4>Linux</h4>
    
    <p>
      RPM packages are starting to become available on the sourceforge site. 
    </p>
    
    <p>     
      The RPM should be compatible with all RPM based Linux distributions. By default, 
      the OmegaT package will install itself in the directory /opt/omegat. This is 
      in accord with the Linux Filesystem Hierarchy Standard(FHS) which specifies 
      that all non-essential (non-system related) applications be installed under 
      /opt. If an /opt directory does not exist the installation RPM will create 
      it. Note that system administrator privileges are required to install the 
      package. Contact your system administrator if it cannot be installed. Please 
      note that this differs from the other installation methods in that it is 
      a system-wide installation. As such, each user will have their own OmegaT 
      preferences file in their home directory distinct from all other users. In
      this way separate users can log in and have their own preferences rather 
      than relying on a single preferences setup for all users.
    </p>

    <h4>Mac OS X</h4>

    <p>
      OS X users can download a Mac OS X package that automatically installs a Mac 
      OS X bundle into /Applications/. As usual, the final installation directory 
      can be modified if desired.
    </p>
 
    <h4>Windows</h4>

    <p>
      Windows users can download a Windows binary installer 
      
      <b>OmegaT_1.4.x_setup.exe</b>
       
      and just run it. In this case, the installer creates a shortcut to launch 
      OmegaT from the 
      
      <i>Start > Programs</i>
      
      menu.
    </p>

    <h3>OmegaT Configuration (UNIX only)</h3>

    <p>
      If installation on a UNIX based system is done by using the generic archive, 
      and you are not very familiar with the platform, perform the following to make
      launching of OmegaT more user-friendly:
    </p>

    <p>
      Save the following Bash shell script content as a text file:
    </p>

    <code>
      #!/bin/bash
      <br>
      
      cd 
      
      <i>&lt;OmegaT&gt;</i>
      <br>
      
      <i>&lt;java&gt;/</i>java -jar OmegaT.jar
    </code>

    <p>
      where 
      
      <b>&lt;OmegaT&gt;</b> 
      
      is the directory containing the file 
      
      <b>OmegaT.jar</b> 
      
      and 
      
      <b>&lt;java&gt;</b> 
      
      is the directory containing the J2RE binary (the file named 
      
      <b>java</b>). 
      
      If the Java path variable is set, it is not necessary to specify this 
      directory, and 
      
      <code>java -jar OmegaT.jar</code> 
      
      is sufficient to launch the program. Specifying the directory is necessary if 
      the Java path variable is not set, and also if the system has more than one 
      version of Java installed and a specific version needs to be used to launch
      OmegaT.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      If Bash is not the default shell program change the first line of the script
      to reflect this (e.g. for Korn shell use
    
      <code>
        #!/bin/ksh
      </code>
    
      in place of
      
      <code>
        #!/bin/bash
      </code>)
    </p>

    <p>
      Save the script as 
      
      <b>OmegaT</b>, 
      <b>omegat</b>,
      
      or under whatever name is preferred. Then set the file permissions of the 
      script to executable (e.g. via
      
      <code>
      $ chmod u+x OmegaT
      </code>
      
      in a shell, or if using Konqueror, context menu &gt; 
      
      <i>Properties</i> &gt; 
      <i>Permissions</i> &gt; 
      <i>Exec</i>). 
      
      OmegaT can then be launched from the command line by typing the name given
      to the script. To launch from the desktop, create an icon and set it to execute 
      the shell script file.
    </p>
    
    <h2>OmegaT Execution</h2>

    <h3>Mac OS X</h3>

    <p>
      If the Mac OS X bundle has been installed, simply click on the OmegaT icon 
      located in the install directory. In the case where only the standard Java 
      files have been downloaded and installed, simply click on the OmegaT.jar 
      file in a Finder window. OmegaT can also be launched from the Terminal (in 
      a way similar to the command line under Linux). See the UNIX configuration
      and execution sections for more information. 
    </p>

    <h3>UNIX</h3>

    <p>
      If a generic archive was used for installation then try these instructions
      to launch OmegaT. For RPM install under Linux executing 
      
      <code>
        OmegaT
      </code>
          
      from a shell is enough to launch the application (no default desktop menu 
      entry is available yet).
    </p>
    <p>
      Execute 
      
      <code>java -jar OmegaT.jar</code> 
      
      from the command line. Observe the exact type case of 
      
      <i>OmegaT</i>&#8212;the 
      
      capitals are important.
    </p>

    <p>
      If Java has not been configured to detect the location of the OmegaT files, 
      change directories to the directory containing the file OmegaT.jar.
    </p>

    <p>
      If the Java path variable is not set, specify the complete path first. If 
      neither of the above have been done, a routine to launch the application 
      might look something like this for installation from the generic archive:
    </p>
    
    <code>
      cd /home/<i>&lt;user&gt;</i>/<i>&lt;OmegaT install directory&gt;</i>
      <br>
      
      <i>&lt;JRE directory&gt;</i>/bin/java -jar OmegaT.jar
    </code>

    <p>
      for user Joe Blow, archive installation directory 
    
      <i>OmegaT</i>, and  JRE directory 
    </p>
        
    <code>
      /usr/jre1.5
    </code>
    
    <p>
      this would be
    </p>
    
    <code>
      cd /home/joeblow/OmegaT</i>
      <br>
      
      /usr/jre1.5/bin/java -jar OmegaT.jar
    </code>
        
    <h3>Windows</h3>

    <p>
      If OmegaT has been installed with the help of the Windows installer (see above), 
      it can be launched by clicking on the OmegaT 1.4.x shortcut from the 
      
      <i>Start > Programs > OmegaT</i> 
      
      menu. It is also possible to click on one of the files 
      
      <b>OmegaT.exe</b>, 
      <b>OmegaT.bat</b>, 
      
      or 
      
      <b>OmegaT.jar</b> 
      
      in the file manager.
    </p>

    <h2>Localization</h2>

    <p>
      The language used by OmegaT for the user interface and the user manual
      are set to a default value which depends on your locale and the localizations
      available. Only the following localizations can be used at present:
    </p>
        
    <ul>
      <li>
        Belorussian (be)
      </li>
      <li>
        English (en)
      </li>
      <li>
        Esperanto (eo)
      </li>
      <li>
        French (fr)
      </li>
      <li>
        Japanese (ja)
      </li>
      <li>
        Spanish (es)
      </li>
      <li>
        Russian (ru)
      </li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>        
      If the language desired is not available, the default language will be used.
      This will default to the system locale, if it is one of the localizations 
      available, or English when nothing else is available.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      It is possible to override the default language used by OmegaT by entering 
      the two letter language code, from the list given, to the -Duser.language 
      java option (at the command line or in a shell script). This can be useful 
      when using OmegaT in an environment where the default locale is not supported
      or is different than the one desired. For instance, starting OmegaT with
    </p>
      
    <code>java -Duser.language=fr -jar OmegaT.jar</code>
    
    <p>     
      will set the language to French regardless of whether other applications
      in the windowing environment are in French or not.
    </p>      

    <p>
      More specific locale settings are not supported for the localization of
      OmegaT at present (i.e. via the -Duser.country and -Duser.variant options
      passed to java).
    </p>
        
    <p>     
      Something else to note is the fact that for a language like Japanese it
      may be necessary to use a specific internationalized version of JRE from
      Sun to support character encodings properly. This is most likely in the
      case of Windows installation.
    </p>
    
    <h4>Mac OS X</h4>
    
    <p>
      On Mac OS X, changing the locale can be done from System Preferences in the 
      Apple Menu by selecting the International preference pane. Locales can be
      added and prioritized according to the way any application should be displayed.

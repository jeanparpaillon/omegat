<a name="2.1" />
<h2 name="2.1" id="2.1">Java Runtime Environment</h2>

<p>OmegaT requires a <b>Java Runtime Environment</b>. (also known as <b>JRE</b>). Essentially, if your system will run Java programs it will run OmegaT. Java Runtime Environments are available for the following platforms: Windows 95/98/2000/ME/XP, UNIX, Linux, and Solaris (both x86 and Sun SPARC). Mac OS X comes with one pre-installed.</p>

<p>The computer being used to run OmegaT must have a <b>Java Runtime Environment(JRE)</b> installed on it&#8212;<b>IT WILL NOT WORK WITHOUT ONE INSTALLED!</b></p>

<p>Java and OmegaT can be installed in any order. Configuration is not essential on UNIX based platforms, but it will make launching the application more user-friendly for those that require it.</p>

<p>If uncertain as to whether or not a JRE is installed, install OmegaT first and then test to see if it works (see <a href="./InstallConfig.html#omegat-install">OmegaT Installation</a>). If nothing happens, or error messages are returned, the Java Runtime Environment is almost certainly not installed. In which case, please obtain one and install it first.</p>

<p>Please note that JRE is available in the form of both a standalone product <b>(J2RE)</b> or as part of the <b>Java Software Developer's Kit(J2SDK)</b>.</p>

<p>This OmegaT release requires a JRE version of 1.4 or higher.</p>

<p>As far as the OmegaT project team is aware, OmegaT does <b>NOT</b> run on the following platforms:</p>

<ul><li>Windows NT; the NT Java implementation contains bugs</li>
<li>Mac OS 9; the only Java Runtime Environment available for it (known as MRJ) is too old and does not offer the required functionality.</li></ul>

<a name="2.2" />
<h2 name="2.2" id="2.2">Java installation</h2>

<a name="2.2.1" />
<h3 name="2.2.1" id="2.2.1">Important Notes:</h3>

<p>Sun regularly changes the names of its products&#8212;possibly to confuse its customers. You shouldn't care much, you just need a recent Java Runtime Environment. Version 1.4 or above, be it Java 2 <b>version 1.4.2</b> or Java 5 <b>version 1.5.0</b>.</p>

<p>Other related (or not so related) forms of Java exist:</p>

<ul>
<li>Java for embedded web browser applications (i.e. via plugins);</li>
<li>JavaScript scripting language for webpages (technically unrelated to Java).</li>
</ul>

<p>Neither of these forms of Java will enable OmegaT to run.</p>


<a name="2.2.2" />
<h3 name="2.2.2" id="2.2.2">Java on Windows</h3>

<p>Check which version of JRE, if any, is installed with <b>Start(button)/Windows key &gt; Settings &gt; Control Panel</b>. If a JRE is already installed, a control panel applet labelled "Java" or similar will be present. Launch it and check whether it has the version 1.4 or higher.</p>
<p>Please note that as of this writing the current Java version available on Windows is in the 1.5 range (stable version). OmegaT is tested to work with this version.</p>
<p>1.4.x versions of OmegaT should work with any JRE version 1.4 upwards.</p>

<p>Users can download the Java Runtime Environment from:<br>
Sun at <a href="http://java.sun.com/getjava/index.html">http://java.sun.com/getjava/index.html</a></p>
<p>Installation instructions for JRE can be found on the website where it is downloaded from or accompanying the downloaded file or package once it has been opened or unarchived.</p>

<a name="2.2.3" />
<h3 name="2.2.3" id="2.2.3">Java on UNIX (includes Linux & Solaris)</h3>

<p>Type <code>java -version</code> at a command prompt in a console or terminal program. The version installed will be returned(if Java is installed as an executeable in your shell path).</p>
<p>Please note that as of this writing the current Java version available on Linux is in the 1.5 range (stable version). OmegaT is tested to work with this version.</p>
<p>1.4.x versions of OmegaT should work with any JRE version 1.4 upwards.</p>

<p>Users can download the Java Runtime Environment from:<br>
Sun at <a href="http://java.sun.com/getjava/index.html">http://java.sun.com/getjava/index.html</a><br>
Blackdown (Linux) at <a href="http://www.blackdown.org/java-linux.html">http://www.blackdown.org/java-linux.html</a></p>
<p>Installation instructions for JRE can be found on the website where it is downloaded from or accompanying the downloaded file or package once it has been opened or unarchived.</p>


<a name="2.2.4" />
<h3 name="2.2.4" id="2.2.4">Java on MacOSX</h3>

<p><b>Mac users</b>: On MacOSX, a JRE is pre-installed and configured. This is the only platform that does not require the user to install a JRE. If OmegaT does not work, make sure to run Software Update from the Apple Menu to get the latest JRE available for your version of OSX. OmegaT is known to work on OS X from OS X 10.2 to the most recent OS X 10.4.3 update.

<p>Please note that as of this writing the current Java version available on MacOSX is Java 1.4.2. OmegaT is tested to work with this version.</p>

<p>Earlier versions of OmegaT (namely 1.0) are known to run on the MRJ for Macintosh OS 9. OmegaT version 1.4 or greater will not run on this platform.</p>

<p>To run an OmegaT 1.0 version, download the MRJ for Mac OS9 from the <a href="http://www.apple.com">Apple</a>  website. OmegaT 1.0 is an obsolete version and this documentation makes no further reference to it.</p>

<a name="2.3" />
<h2 name="2.3" id="2.3">OmegaT Installation</h2>

<a name="2.3.1" />
<h3 name="2.3.1" id="2.3.1">All Platforms</h3>

<p>A generic OmegaT archive is available for installation. This version of OmegaT works on Linux, Solaris, MacOSX, and Windows (and possibly others). See <a href="./SystemReqs.html">System Requirements<a> also.</p>

<p>Simply extract the contents of the .zip archive into the directory of your choice.</p>

<a name="2.3.2" />
<h3 name="2.3.2" id="2.3.2">Windows</h3>

<p>Windows users can download a Windows binary installer and just run it. In this case, the installer creates a shortcut to launch OmegaT from the <b>Start > Programs</b> menu.</p>

<a name="2.3.3" />
<h3 name="2.3.3" id="2.3.3">MacOSX</h3>

<p>OSX users can download a MacOSX package that automatically installs a MacOSX bundle into a specified directory. This package includes a docking icon and a double clickable application.</p>

<a name="2.4" />
<h2 name="2.4" id="2.4">OmegaT Configuration</h2>

<a name="2.4.1" />
<h3 name="2.4.1" id="2.4.1">UNIX</h3>

<p>This section is for UNIX users but MacOSX command line users can also benefit from it.</p>

<p>If installation on a UNIX based system is done by using the generic archive, and you are not very familiar with the platform, perform the following to make launching of OmegaT more user-friendly:</p>
<p>Save the following Bash shell script content as a text file:</p>
<code>#!/bin/bash<br> cd <b>&lt;OmegaT&gt;</b><br><b>&lt;java&gt;/</b>java -jar OmegaT.jar</code>
<p>where <b>&lt;OmegaT&gt;</b> is the directory containing the file <b>OmegaT.jar</b> and <b>&lt;java&gt;</b> is the directory containing the J2RE binary (the file named <b>java</b>). If the Java path variable is set, it is not necessary to specify this directory, and <code>java -jar OmegaT.jar</code> is sufficient to launch the program. Specifying the directory is necessary if the Java path variable is not set, and also if the system has more than one version of Java installed and a specific version needs to be used to launch OmegaT.</p>
<p>If Bash is not the default shell program change the first line of the script to reflect this (e.g. for Korn shell use <code> #!/bin/ksh</code>in place of<code> #!/bin/bash</code>)</p>
<p>Save the script as <b>OmegaT</b>, <b>omegat</b>, or under whatever name is preferred. Then set the file permissions of the script to executable (e.g. via<code>$ chmod u+x OmegaT</code> in a shell, or if using Konqueror, context menu &gt; <b>Properties</b> &gt; <b>Permissions</b> &gt; <b>Exec</b>). OmegaT can then be launched from the command line by typing the name given to the script. To launch from the desktop, create an icon and set it to execute the shell script file.</p>

<a name="2.5" />
<h2 name="2.5" id="2.5">OmegaT Execution</h2>

<a name="2.5.1" />
<h3 name="2.5.1" id="2.5.1">Windows</h3>

<p>If OmegaT has been installed with the help of the Windows installer (see above), it can be launched by clicking on the OmegaT shortcut from the <b>Start > Programs > OmegaT</b> menu. It is also possible to click on one of the files <b>OmegaT.exe</b>, <b>OmegaT.bat</b>, or <b>OmegaT.jar</b> in the file manager.</p>

<a name="2.5.2" />
<h3 name="2.5.2" id="2.5.1">UNIX</h3>

<p>Execute <code>java -jar OmegaT.jar</code> from the command line. Observe the exact type case of <b>OmegaT</b>&#8212;the capitals are important.</p>
<p>If Java has not been configured to detect the location of the OmegaT files, change directories to the directory containing the file OmegaT.jar.</p>
<p>If the Java path variable is not set, specify the complete path first. If neither of the above have been done, a routine to launch the application might look something like this for installation from the generic archive:</p>
<code>cd /home/ <b>&lt;user&gt;</b>/ <b>&lt;OmegaT install directory&gt;</b><br><b>&lt;JRE directory&gt;</b>/bin/java -jar OmegaT.jar</code>
<p>for user Joe Blow, archive installation directory <b>OmegaT</b>, and JRE directory</p>
<code>/usr/jre1.5</code>
<p>this would be</p>
<code>cd /home/joeblow/OmegaT</b><br> /usr/jre1.5/bin/java -jar OmegaT.jar</code>

<a name="2.5.3" />
<h3 name="2.5.3" id="2.5.3">MacOSX</h3>

<p>If the MacOSX bundle has been installed, simply click on the OmegaT icon located in the install directory. In the case where only the standard Java files have been downloaded and installed, simply click on the OmegaT.jar file in a Finder window.</p>

<p>OmegaT can also be launched from the Terminal (in a way similar to the command line under Linux). See above the UNIX configuration and execution sections for more information.</p>

<a name="2.6" />
<h2 name="2.6" id="2.6">Changing the user interface language settings</h2>

<p>The language used by OmegaT for the user interface and the user manual are set to a default value which depends on both your user environment and the available localizations. English will be used when there is no localization corresponding to your environment. For the list of available localizations, see below <a href="#2.7">Available languages for OmegaT 1.6</a>.</p>

<a name="2.6.1" />
<h3 name="2.6.1" id="2.6.1">UNIX</h3>

<p>It is possible to override the default language used by OmegaT by entering the two letter language code, from the list given, to the -Duser.language java option (at the command line or in a shell script). This can be useful when using OmegaT in an environment where the default locale is not supported or is different than the one desired. For instance, starting OmegaT with <pre>    java -Duser.language=fr -jar OmegaT.jar</pre> will start OmegaT in French regardless of whether other applications in the windowing environment are in French or not.</p>

<p>More specific locale settings are not supported for the localization of OmegaT at present (i.e. via the -Duser.country and -Duser.variant options passed to java).</p>

<p>Something else to note is the fact that for a language like Japanese it may be necessary to use a specific internationalized version of JRE from Sun to support character encodings properly. This is most likely in the case of Windows installation.</p>

<a name="2.6.2" />
<h3 name="2.6.2" id="2.6.2">MacOSX</h3>

<p>On MacOSX, changing the locale can be done from System Preferences in the Apple Menu by modifying the contents of the International preference pane.</p>

<a name="2.7" />
<h2 name="2.7" id="2.7">Available languages for OmegaT 1.6</h2>

<p><b>Full localization</b>: graphical user interface + instant tutorial + user manual<br>
<b>Partial localization</b>: graphical user interface + instant tutorial<br>
<b>Non up-to-date localization</b>: older version user manual (1.4.4 or 1.4.5)</p>

<a name="2.7.1" />
<h3 name="2.7.1" id="2.7.1">Full localizations</h3>
<p>OmegaT 1.6 has been fully localized in the following languages:

<ul><li>.</li>
<li>.</li>
<li>.</li>
<li>.</li>
<li>.</li></ul></p>

<a name="2.7.2" />
<h3 name="2.7.2" id="2.7.2">Partial localizations</h3>
<p>Partial localizations are available in the following languages:

<ul><li>.</li>
<li>.</li>
<li>.</li>
<li>.</li>
<li>.</li></ul></p>

<a name="2.7.3" />
<h3 name="2.7.3" id="2.7.3">Non up-to-date localizations</h3>
<p>Non up-to-date localizations are available in the following languages:

<ul><li>.</li>
<li>.</li>
<li>.</li>
<li>.</li>
<li>.</li></ul></p>

<a name="2.8" />
<h2 name="2.8" id="2.8">Language Character Sets and Fonts</h2>

<p>OmegaT provides for text display font settings.</p>

<p>In order to permit translation between two languages which employ different character sets, select a font which contains the character sets of both alphabets. Installation of additional fonts might be necessary in certain cases.</p>

<p>A different display font can be selected via the <b>Display Font</b> dialog. Open it via the <b>Settings</b> &gt; <b>Display Font...</b> menu item. The font type and size can be changed from the dialog.</p>
<p>Note that the font selected applies only to the user interface display (i.e. the <b>Editor</b> and <b>Match and Glossary Viewer</b> windows. It has no effect on the fonts used within the source and target documents. The fonts available for selection are those which are available on your system.</p>

<p><b>Warning!</b> It may take a noticeable amount of time for OmegaT to update the display after you have changed the font setting, especially when a big project is opened. Also, some fonts behave better for some language pairs than for others. Generally speaking, it is better to change of font <b>before</b> opening a project.</p>

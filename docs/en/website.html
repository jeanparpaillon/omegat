	<h1>OmegaT on the web</h1>

	<h2>OmegaT sites and OmegaT SourceForge project</h2>

	<p>The <a href="http://www.omegat.org/">OmegaT web site</a> contains links to various OmegaT resources, so you should probably start there. User support is provided at the <a href= "http://groups.yahoo.com/group/OmegaT/">OmegaT Yahoo User Group</a>. The archives are searchable even without joining the group. New versions of OmegaT can be downloaded from <a href= "http://sourceforge.net/projects/omegat/">OmegaT SourceForge.net Project</a>, where you may also file <a href="http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=68187&amp;atid=520347">bug reports</a> and
	<a href="http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=68187&amp;atid=520350">requests for enhancements</a>.</p>

	<p>Remember though, every good bug report needs exactly three things:</p>

	<ul>
		<li>Steps to reproduce</li>
		<li>What you expected to see</li>
		<li>What you saw instead</li>
	</ul>

		<p>More in <a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/fog0000000029.html">Painless Bug Tracking</a> article by Joel Spolsky</p>

		<p>You should add copies of files, portions of the log, screen shots, anything that you think will help the developers to find and fix your bug. Note that bug reports and requests for enhancements are publicly visible, so you should not add any sensitive files. If you want to keep track of what is happening to the report you should register as a SourceForge user, login and file a bug report being logged in, or simply click Monitor on top of the report.</p>

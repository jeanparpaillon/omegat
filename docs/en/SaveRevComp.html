<h2 name="8.1" id="8.1">Save</h2>

<p>OmegaT automatically saves translated segments at very shorts intervals of time. Nevertheless, never forget to save your work at regular times. For this, select <b>Save Translation Memory</b> from the <b>File</b> menu, or press <b>&lt;Ctrl+S&gt;</b>.</p>
<p>This will save your translation as an intermediate translation memory, in the file <b>/omegat/project_save.tmx</b>.</p>
<p>To generate an up-to-date translation memory for the project, or target translated documents, compile the project (see the <b>Compilation</b> section).</p>

<a name="8.2" />
<h2 name="8.2" id="8.2">Revision</h2>

<p>To revise a translation, select its source file from the <b>Project Files</b> window and step through each segment, stopping in a segment to revise as necessary. When all segments of a file have been revised OmegaT will automatically switch to the next file in the list.</p>

<p>Translators familiar with other translation memory applications will appreciate this convenient method of revision.</p>

<a name="8.3" />
<h2 name="8.3" id="8.3">Compilation</h2>

<p>Do not be intimidated by the computerese!</p>
<p>During translation with OmegaT the original source text is not overwritten. Each time a new translation is accepted (e.g. by pressing <b>&lt;Enter&gt;</b>) it is stored in computer memory until the project translation memory (<b>project_save.tmx</b>) is automatically saved, or until the user either performs a compilation to create the target documents or saves the translation memory.</p>

<p>If the application is closed before any of these actions takes place all unsaved translations will be lost.</p>
<p>The process of compilation, done via <b>Create Target Documents</b> from the <b>File</b> menu, causes OmegaT to generate the translated documents and project TMX from the data in the temporary translation memory (<b>project_save.tmx</b>).</p>
<p>A complete translation of a text does not have to be done before compilation is performed. It is possible to compile at any time. Of course, the resulting target documents will only be partially translated in this case.</p>
<p>Using <b>Save Translation Memory</b> from the <b>File</b> menu operates in the same way as for compilation, except that the target documents are not created.</p>

<a name="8.4" />
<h2 name="8.4" id="8.4">Precautions</h2>

<p>To avoid possible loss of data or disaster, here are a few suggestions:</p>

<ul><li>Make regular backup copies of the file <b>/omegat/project_save.tmx</b>. A good idea would be to add a serial number or the date to each copy, for instance, <b>/omegat/project_save.tmx-01</b>. or <b>/omegat/project_save.tmx-07-06-05</b>. Backups can be transferred to other media such as floppy disk, CD-RW, or other hard disk if they are available. Then project_save.tmx can be conveniently restored from backup if something goes wrong.</li>
<li>Make compilations at regular intervals and check that the compiled file contains the latest version of a translation. In particular, this should be done when first starting out with OmegaT.</li>
<li>Take particular care when making any changes to the files in <b>/source</b>. in the middle of a project. Sometimes it might be necessary to make changes to source files, for example to remove hard line breaks from the middle of sentences. However, if the source file is modified after translation has begun, OmegaT may be unable to find a segment that has already been translated. Always backup the source file itself, or the whole project, before making any changes to the source file(s).</li>
</ul>

<p>Please keep in mind that OmegaT creates a backup of a project's translation memory in the <b>project_save.tmx.bak</b> file in the project's <b>/omegat</b> subdirectory whenever a project is opened and before any modifications are made.</p>

<p>OmegaT is a robust application. It is not prone to crashes or data loss and corruption. However, you should take precautions against data loss when using OmegaT, just as with any other application.</p>

    <h1 align="center">Translation: Save, Revision, and Compilation</h1>

    <h2>Save</h2>
    
    <p>
      To save your work at any time, select 
      
      <i>Save Translation Memory</i> 
      
      from the 
      
      <i>File</i> 
      
      menu, or press
      
      <i>&lt;Ctrl+S&gt;</i>. 
    </p>
    
    <p>
      This will save your translation as an intermediate translation memory, 
      in the file 
      
      <b>/omegat/project_save.tmx</b>.
       
      To generate an up-to-date translation memory for the project, or target translated
      documents, compile the project (see the 
      
      <i>Compilation</i>
       
      section).
    </p>
       
    <h2>Revision</h2>

    <p>
      To revise a translation, select its source file from the 
      
      <i>Project Files</i>
       
      window and step through each segment by pressing 
      
      <i>&lt;Enter&gt;</i>
      
      repeatedly, stopping in a segment to revise as necessary. When all segments 
      of a file have been revised OmegaT will automatically switch to the next 
      file in the list. Translators familiar with other translation memory applications
      will appreciate this convenient method of revision.
    </p>

    <h2>Compilation</h2>

    <p>
      Do not be intimidated by the computerese! 
    </p>

    <p>
      During translation with OmegaT the original source text is not overwritten.
      Each time a new translation is accepted (e.g. by pressing 
      
      <i>&lt;Enter&gt;</i>)
      
      it is stored in computer memory along with all other unsaved translations 
      until the project translation memory 
      
      (<b>project_save.tmx</b>) 
          
      is automatically saved (at approximately 20 minute intervals), or the 
      user either performs a compilation to create the target documents or saves 
      the translation memory. If the application is closed before any of these actions
      takes place all unsaved translations will be lost.
    </p>

    <p>      
      The process of compilation, done via 
       
      <i>Create Target Documents</i> 
      
      from the
      
      <i>File</i>
      
      menu, causes OmegaT to generate the translated documents and project TMX.
      In order to do this, any new unsaved translations are merged together into
      
      <b>project_save.tmx</b>
      
      with previously saved ones and then segments from the original text are replaced
      by these translations in the target documents.      
    </p>

    <p>  
      A complete translation of a text does not have to be done before compilation 
      is performed. It is possible to compile at any time. Of course, the resulting 
      target documents will only be partially translated in this case.
    </p>

    <p>  
      Using
            
      <i>Save Translation Memory</i> 
      
      from the
      
      <i>File</i>
      
      menu operates in the same way as for compilation, except that the target
      documents are not created.
    </p>
    
    <h2>Precautions</h2>
    
    <p>      
      To avoid possible loss of data or disaster, here are a few suggestions:
    </p>
    
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          Make regular backup copies of the file
          
          <b>/omegat/project_save.tmx</b>. 
          
          A good idea would be to add a serial number or the date to each copy, 
          for instance, 
          
          <b>/omegat/project_save.tmx-01</b> 
          
          or 
          
          <b>/omegat/project_save.tmx-07-06-05</b>. 
          
          Backups can be transferred to other media such as floppy disk, CD-RW, or
          other hard disk if they are available. Then project_save.tmx can be 
          conveniently restored from backup if something goes wrong. 
        </p>  
          
        <p>
          Please note that when translating formatted (OpenDocument, OpenOffice.org,
          StarOffice, XHTML, or HTML) files it is likely that  
          
          <b>project_save.tmx</b> 
          
          is much smaller than the original or final texts. 
        </p>
      </li>  
      <li>
        <p>
          Make compilations at regular intervals and check that the compiled file 
          contains the latest version of a translation. In particular, this should 
          be done when first starting out with OmegaT.
        </p>
      </li>  
      <li>
        <p>
          Take particular care when making any changes to the files in 
          
          <b>/source</b> 
          
          in the middle of a project. Sometimes it might be necessary to make changes 
          to source files, for example to remove hard line breaks from the middle of 
          sentences. However, if the source file is modified after translation has
          begun, OmegaT may be unable to find a segment that has already been
          translated. Always backup the source file itself, or the whole project, 
          before making any changes to the source file(s).
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>          
          When creating a new project, do not forget that OmegaT will open its
          file selection dialog at the location it was last used. In most cases, 
          this will be inside a project directory to select the 
          
          <b>omegat.project</b> 
          
          file. Make sure that the directory selected is not within an existing
          project.          
        </p>
      </li>  
    </ul>

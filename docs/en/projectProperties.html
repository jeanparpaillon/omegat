  <h1 style="margin-left: 0.05cm">Project properties</h1>

  <p style="margin-left: 1.00cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">This dialog is used to modify the project folders and languages. It may be opened by pressing <code><a href=
  "keyboardShortcuts.html">Ctrl+E</a></code> or by calling <strong>Project -&gt; Properties...</strong> from the <a href="menu.html">main menu</a>. The dialog contains:</p>

  <ul>
    <li style="margin-left: 1.00cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">Area for setting project source and target languages with drop-down menus</li>

    <li style="margin-left: 1.00cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">Segmentation settings flag</li>

    <li style="margin-left: 1.00cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">Area for setting project folders</li>
  </ul>

  <p style="margin-left: 1.00cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">All the fields are editable. You can either enter the languages by hand or use the drop down menu. You can type names of folders that do not exist
  yet, and OmegaT will create them for you.</p>

  <h3 style="margin-left: 0.05cm">Modifying project properties during the session</h3>

  <p style="margin-left: 1.00cm; text-indent: 0.03cm">It is possible to modify the project properties during a translation session, however you have to bear in mind that changing the languages may
  render the currently used translation memories useless since their language may not match new languages anymore. If you change the segmentation settings, some already translated segments may get
  split or merged. This will practically return them to the "untranslated" status, even though the old and now not-matching translation is still in the translation memory. OmegaT may <a href=
  "translationMemories.html#Upgrading_Translation_Memories">upgrade old translation memories</a> that did not use sentence segmentation, but not vice versa, and not the project's translation memory
  if you change your mind in the middle of the translation.</p>

  <p style="margin-left: 1.00cm; text-indent: 0.03cm">In case you intend to modify project folders, remember that this will not move the files from old folders to new ones, so you risk ending up in a
  situation neither you or OmegaT know what the folders really mean, and which of them are used.</p>

  <p style="margin-left: 0.93cm">The safest way is to consider all settings as final once the translation has started - unless of course you realize a major mistake has been made. See the <a href=
  "preventingDataLoss.html">Preventing data loss</a> section for ways to protect your work.</p>

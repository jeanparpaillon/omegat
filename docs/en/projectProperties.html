	<h1>Properties dialog</h1>

	<p>This dialog is used to modify the project folders and languages. It may be opened by pressing <code><a href= "menu.html#shortcuts">Ctrl+E</a></code> or by calling <strong>Project â†’ Properties...</strong> from the <a href="menu.html">main menu</a>. The dialog contains:</p>

	<ul>
		<li>Area for setting project source and target languages with drop-down menus</li>
		<li>Segmentation settings flag</li>
		<li>Area for setting project folders</li>
	</ul>

	<p>All the fields are editable. You can either enter the languages by hand or use the drop down menu. You can type names of folders that do not exist yet, and OmegaT will create them for you.</p>
	

	<a name="language" id="language"></a>
	<h2>Language modification</h2>
	
	<p>You have to bear in mind that changing the languages may render the currently used translation memories useless since their language may not match new languages anymore.</p>
	
	<a name="segments" id="segments"></a>
	<h2>Segmentation modifications</h2>
	
	<p>The segmentation settings only modify the way the source files are handled by OmegaT. They do not modify the segmentation of the already existing translation memories.</p>
	
	<p>If you change the segmentation settings, some already translated segments may get split or merged. This will practically return them to the "untranslated" status because they do not match segments recorded in the project memory, even though the old and now not-matching translation is still there.</p>
	
	<p>OmegaT may <a href= "translationMemories.html#Upgrading_Translation_Memories">upgrade old translation memories</a> that did not use sentence segmentation, but not vice versa, and not the project's translation memory if you change your mind in the middle of the translation.</p>

	<a name="folder" id="folder"></a>
	<h2>Folder structure modifications</h2>
	
	<p>In case you intend to modify project folders, remember that this will not move the contained files from old folders to new ones. You risk ending up in a situation neither you or OmegaT know what the folders really mean, and which of them are used.</p>

	<h1>Modifying project properties during the session</h1>

	<p>It is possible to modify the project properties during a translation session.</p>
	
	<p>However, the safest way is to consider all settings as final once the translation has started - unless of course you realize a major mistake has been made. See the <a href= "preventingDataLoss.html">Preventing data loss</a> section for ways to protect your work.</p>

<a name="6.1" />
<h2 name="6.1" id="6.1">Segments</h2>

<p>Translation memory tools work with textual units called segments. There are multiple ways to segment a text.</p>

<p>OmegaT first parses the text for structure-level segmentation. During this process it is only the structure of the source file that is used to produce segments.</p>

<p>Starting from version 1.6, OmegaT may segment by sentence. More about it in <a href="./SentSeg.html">Sentence Segmentation</a>. Sentence segmentation takes place after structure-level segmentation.</p>

<p>Segments created during either process cannot be changed (split or merged) during translation.</p>

<p>If you are not satified with the segmentation you will need to either modify the file externally and/or to modify the sentence segmentation rules. Once this is done you will need to reload the project for your modifications to be taken into account.

<a name="6.2" />
<h2 name="6.2" id="6.2">File Structure Segmentation</h2>

<a name="6.2.1" />
<h3 name="6.2.1" id="6.2.1">Text Files</h3>

<p>Segmentation for text files in OmegaT occurs at line breaks. Line breaks are sometimes found at the end of sentences and sometimes at the end of paragraphs.</p>

<p>Paragraph-level segments, sentence-level segments, or segments that include parts of sentences will be created depending upon how your text file is formatted. Therefore, it is possible to force segmentation at any level by editing the line breaks in a file.</p>

<p>Don't forget to <b>reload</b> your project once you have modified your files.</p>

<a name="6.2.2" />
<h3 name="6.2.2" id="6.2.2">Java Resource Bundles</h3>

<p>Since 1.4.4 OmegaT supports Java Resource Bundle files. These files use one line per language item (character string) to be translated. The segmentation is very similar to that of text files, except that it is not possible to modify the segment boundaries.</p>

<a name="6.2.3" />
<h3 name="6.2.3" id="6.2.3">Tagged (Formatted) Files</h3>

<p>Relevant tagged files in OmegaT include: HTML, XHTML, OpenDocument, OpenOffice.org, and StarOffice. In general, these files contain two types of tags:</p>

<ul>
<li>in line&#8212;usually defines the style of the text;</li>
<li>block level&#8212;usually describes its logical structure.</li>
</ul>  

<p>Segmentation in formatted files occurs at block level tags.</p>

<a name="6.2.4" />
<h3 name="6.2.4" id="6.2.4">(X)HTML Files</h3>

<p>Since version 1.6, OmegaT parses the internals of the (X)HTML file and extracts parts of the code that do not appear on the screen but that still need to be translated.</p>

<p>Typically this includes string data of human readable attributes like: <b>abbr</b>, <b>alt</b> to offer an alternative textual description of a picture, <b>content</b>, <b>href</b>, <b>hreflang</b>, <b>lang</b> to describe the file language, <b>src</b>, <b>summary</b>, <b>title</b> and <b>value</b>. Such strings appear as one segment.

<a name="6.2.5" />
<h3 name="6.2.5" id="6.2.5">Spreadsheets, tables, visual presentation</h3>

<p>Text elements in a spreadsheet, a table or a visual presentation, among other documents a translator usually works with, will be segmented according to the object (cell etc.) that contains them.</p>

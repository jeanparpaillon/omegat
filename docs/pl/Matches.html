    <p>When a segment becomes active, OmegaT scans the current project translation memory file and any other translation memories found in the <b>/tm</b> directory of the project for matches.</p>
    
    <p>If an exact 100% match is found in a project's TMX it is automatically inserted into the target text field of the active segment and any other matching segments in the same document. It must be understood that close matches such as "Hi!" and "Hi" are in fact not 100% matches to OmegaT and will not be inserted automatically. Any fuzzy matches that are located will be displayed in the <i>Matches</i> pane of the <i>Match and Glossary Viewer</i> window.</p>

    <p>OmegaT looks for matches in two ways and has three types of matches. The first way it looks for matches is by space separation of words (e.g. in English or French). The other way looks for matches in texts without spaces (specifically Japanese in OmegaT 1.4.4).</p>
    
    <p>The three types of matches are:</p>
    
    <ul>
      <li>Exact matches (100%). These matches are automatically copied into the segments they are identical to without being user selected. This only happens if the match belongs to the project's translation memory (i.e. file project_save.tmx located in the /omegat/ directory). Any exact match found in other translation memory files located in /tm/ will not be automatically inserted, they must be deliberately inserted.</li>
      <li>Fuzzy matches (100%). Matches such as these differ by a punctuation mark, a number, or other similar characters. These are not automatically inserted.</li>
      <li>Fuzzy matches (Less than 100%). Again, these are not automatically inserted.</li>
    </ul>
        
    <p>A maximum of five full or fuzzy matches can be displayed in the window at any one time. Press <i>&lt;Ctrl+1&gt;</i>, to select the first match, and <i>&lt;Ctrl+2&gt;</i> to select the second, and so forth. The selected match is then displayed in bold. The name of the translation memory file containing the match shown is also displayed (i.e. when the match is not part of the current project).</p>

    <p>A selected match can be pasted into the active segment by using <i>&lt;Ctrl-I&gt;</i> to insert the match at the current cursor position or <i>&lt;Ctrl-R&gt;</i> to substitute it for the active segment text.</p>

    <p>The percentage match value indicated by OmegaT is of technical interest only. It does not in any way indicate how much work has been done.</p>
    
    <p>The exact differences between the active source segment and the fuzzy match are not indicated, but colors are used to give an approximate idea of what the differences are. Green strings are included in the source segment, blue strings are not.</p>

    <ul>  
      <li>
        <p>
          <b>Errors:</b> in general, if errors or program bugs are encountered or suspected there is a log file (<b>log.txt</b>) in the root directory of a project that can be checked. Errors and bugs can be reported to the users group or development team (see <a href="Important.html">Important Notes</a> also).</p>
      </li>
      
      <li>
        <p>
          <b>File conversion and placement:</b> if the original source documents intended for translation are in an unsupported file format remember to convert them to OpenDocument or other supported format and place them in the <b>/source</b> sub-directory of the project. It is usually only necessary to place the converted source documents in this directory. The originals can be kept in a different directory. Any documents that are included in this directory that are in an unsupported format will be copied to the <b>/target</b> directory without modification when the project is compiled.</p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p>
          <b>Markers:</b> to insert a marker in your translation, to indicate an unresolved query or for some other reason, do not use <b>?</b> or <b>*</b>. These characters are used in searches (as wildcards) and are therefore impossible to find with <i>&lt;Ctrl-F&gt;</i>.</p>
      </li>      
      
      <li>
        <p>
          <b>Project creation location:</b> remember that when creating a new project OmegaT will open its file selection dialog to the location it was last used at. This will most likely be inside a project directory. There is little benefit to creating one project inside another, so make sure that the top level directory where a project is to be created is not within an existing project.</p>
      </li>      
      
      <li>
        <p>
          <b>Project is empty after creation:</b> if OmegaT indicates that a newly created project is empty after the source files for translation have been copied into the <b>/source</b> directory, then the files are probably in an unsupported format (<b>MS Word</b>, etc.). All files must be converted to a supported format, such as OpenDocument text or OpenOffice.org writer, for OmegaT to work with them. See <a href="FilesSourceDoc.html">Source Document Files</a> for details.</p>
      </li>
      
      <li>
        <p>
        
          <b>Segment location:</b> after moving to a segment in a different part of a large project, the location of the previous segment that was being worked on may be difficult to locate in order to return to it. To enable quick segment location, place a unique marker in the current working segment, such as <b>'###xxxx'</b> (where <b>xxxx</b> is a unique value, like the current segment number) then press <i>&lt;Enter&gt;</i>, to confirm the change to the segment before moving to a different location. A search for the unique marker will cause it to be the active segment again.</p>
      </li>
      
      <li>
        <p>
          <b>Text layout viewing:</b> open a separate wordprocessor with the original source text in it to see the layout of text during translation.</p>
      </li>
      
      <li>
        <p>
          <b>Translation memory will not open:</b> if you cannot open a translation memory received from an external source (colleague, customer, etc.) it may be in an unsupported TM format. If it is a TMX file (file extension <b>.tmx</b>), it is probably a higher version than currently supported. OmegaT only supports <b>TMX Version 1.1 (Level 1)</b> presently. The most recent TMX version is 1.4b.</p>

<a name="11.1"></a>
<h2 name="11.1" id="11.1">Matches: exact matches, fuzzy matches</h2>

<p>When a segment becomes active, OmegaT scans the current project translation memory file and any other translation memories found in the <strong>/tm</strong> directory of the project for matches.</p>

<a name="11.1.1"></a>
<h3 name="11.1.1" id="11.1.1">Types of matches</h3>

<dl><dt><strong>Exact matches</strong></dt><dd>These matches are automatically copied into the segments they are identical to without being user selected. This only happens if the match belongs to the project's translation memory (i.e. file project_save.tmx located in the /omegat/ directory). Any exact match found in other translation memory files located in /tm/ will not be automatically inserted, they must be deliberately inserted.</dd>
<dt><strong>Fuzzy matches</strong> (100%)</dt><dd>Matches such as these differ by a punctuation mark, a number, formatting, or other similar characters. These are not automatically inserted.</dd>
<dt>Fuzzy matches (Less than 100%, more than 30%)</dt><dd>These differ by wording, but still have many common words with the active segment. Again, these are not automatically inserted.</dd>
</ul>

<p>The percentage match value indicated by OmegaT is a general indication of how much of the matched string is present in the source segment. It is only of technical interest.</p>

<a name="11.1.2"></a>
<h3 name="11.1.2" id="11.1.2">Using Matches in your work</h3>

<p>The best five fuzzy matches that are located will be displayed in the <strong>Matches</strong> pane of the <strong>Match and Glossary Viewer</strong> window.</p>

<p>Press <strong>&lt;Ctrl+1&gt;</strong>, to select the first match, and <strong>&lt;Ctrl+2&gt;</strong> to select the second, and so forth. The selected match is then displayed in bold. The name of the translation memory file containing the match shown is also displayed when the matching segment belong to an external translation memory.</p>

<p>A selected match can be pasted into the active segment by using <strong>&lt;Ctrl-I&gt;</strong> to insert the match at the current cursor position or <strong>&lt;Ctrl-R&gt;</strong> to substitute it for the active segment text.</p>
<p>The differences between the active source segment and the fuzzy match are indicated by coloring the match: black are those words that are included in the source segment together with their neighbors, green words are included but without their neighbors, and blue words are missing from the active segment.</p>

<a name="11.1.3"></a>
<h3 name="11.1.3" id="11.1.3">Matches Options</h3>

<p>Starting with OmegaT 1.6 you can configure the contents of the target editing field.<p>

<p>The <strong>Option</strong> menu item <strong>Workflow</strong> allows the following configurations:

<dl><dt><strong>Do not copy source text into target field</strong></dt><dd>The default behavior is to have the source text into the target field. You can leave the field blank for immediate writing by setting this option.</dd>
<dt><strong>Insert best fuzzy match into target field</strong></dt><dd>This option will automatically insert the best fuzzy match if the field is empty, or rewrite the field if the source text is present.</dd>
<dt><strong>Minimal similarity</strong></dt><dd>This setting allows you to set the level from which OmegaT considers a fuzzy valid for insertion in the target field. The highest the number is, the most similar the matched segment will be the current source segment.</dd>
<dt><strong>Do not insert "[best fuzzy match]" before the best fuzzy match itself</strong></dt><dd>To make sure you notice the automatic insertion of a "best match" in your target field, OmegaT inserts a [best fuzzy match] string at the beginning of the inserted string. Since the best match is always selected by default (it is the first one), you can use <strong>Ctrl+R</strong> to rewrite the automatically inserted string with the match itself, which will remove the "[best fuzzy match]" part.</dd></dl>

<a name="11.2"></a>
<h2 name="11.2" id="11.2">Glossary items</h2>

<p>OmegaT has an automatic glossary function. By placing an existing glossary, in the <strong>/glossary</strong> directory after creating a project, it will automatically be detected when a project is opened. Terms in the active segment which are found in the glossary file(s) are displayed in the <strong>Glossary</strong> pane of the <strong>Match and Glossary Viewer</strong> window.</p>

<p>The glossary function only finds exact matches for the glossary entry (not inflected forms, etc.).</p>

<p>New terms can be added manually to the glossary file(s) during translation (for example in a text editor), but newly added terms will not be recognized until the project is reloaded.</p>

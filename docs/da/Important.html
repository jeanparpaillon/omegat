<h2 name="3.1" id="3.1">Precautions against data loss!</h2>

<p>OmegaT is a robust application. It is not prone to crashes or data loss and corruption. However, you should take precautions against data loss when using OmegaT, just as with any other application.</p>
<p>In general:</p>

<ul>
<li>use OmegaT on short texts until you are familiar with it.</li>
<li>read <a href="./SaveRevComp.html">Translation: Save, Revision, and Compilation</a> carefully; before working on any important projects.</li>
<li>to avoid any loss of data, manually save a project's translation memory (<strong>Project</strong> &gt; <strong>Save Translation Memory</strong>), even though OmegaT automatically saves translation memory at very short time intervals.</li>
<li>Make regular backup copies of the file <strong>/omegat/project_save.tmx</strong>. A good idea would be to add a serial number or the date to each copy, for instance, <strong>/omegat/project_save.tmx-01</strong>. or <strong>/omegat/project_save.tmx-07-06-05</strong>. Backups can be transferred to other media such as floppy disk, CD-RW, or other hard disk if they are available. Then project_save.tmx can be conveniently restored from backup if something goes wrong.</li>
<li>Make compilations at regular intervals and check that the compiled file contains the latest version of a translation. In particular, this should be done when first starting out with OmegaT.</li>
<li>Take particular care when making any changes to the files in <strong>/source</strong> in the middle of a project. Sometimes it might be necessary to make changes to source files, for example to remove hard line breaks from the middle of sentences. However, if the source file is modified after translation has begun, OmegaT may be unable to find a segment that has already been translated. Similarly, changes to the sentence segmentation rules while working on a project may deeply affect your translation. Always backup the source file itself, or the whole project, before making any changes to the source file(s) or to the sentence segmentation rules.</li></ul>

<p>Please keep in mind that OmegaT creates a backup of a project's translation memory in the <strong>project_save.tmx.bak</strong> file in the project's <strong>/omegat</strong> subdirectory whenever a project is opened and before any modifications are made.</p>

<p>Most users will be able to get started with the aid of this manual. If problems arise then post a message to the OmegaT users group located at <a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/omegat"> http://groups.yahoo.com/group/omegat</a> with details of the particular situation. Do not hesitate to post in the language you feel the most familiar with.</p>

<a name="3.2"></a>
<h2 name="3.2" id="3.2">Error Logging</h2>

<p>OmegaT creates a log file (<strong>log.txt</strong>) in the application's install directory with errors encountered during operation. If errors are encountered they can be posted to the OmegaT users group or, if they are definitely programming bugs, submitted to the OmegaT sourceforge Bugs page (accesible via <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/omegat">http://sourceforge.net/projects/omegat</a>.)</p>

<p>An OmegaT error log looks like this:</p>
<pre>

<h2 name="3.3" id="3.3">Bug reports</h2>

<p>Before reporting a bug, make sure that you have thouroughly checked the documentation. What you see may instead be a characteristic of OmegaT that you have just discovered. If you check the OmegaT log and you see words like "ERROR" or "died unexpectedly" (see above) then you are on to something.<p>

<p>The next thing you do is confirm what you found with other users, to make sure this has not already been reported. You can verify the bug report page at SourceForge too. Only when you are sure you are the first to have found some reproductible sequence of event that triggered something not supposed to happen should you file a bug report:</p>

<p>It's pretty easy to remember the rule for a good bug report.<br>
Every good bug report needs exactly three things.</p>

<ol><li> Steps to reproduce,</li>
<li> What you expected to see, and</li>
<li> What you saw instead.</li></ol>

<p>You can add copies of files, portions of the log, screenshots, anything that you think will help the developers with finding and fixing your bug.</p>

<p>To browse the archives of the user group, go to:<br><a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/OmegaT/">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/OmegaT/</a></p>
<p>To browse the bug report page and file a new bug report if necessary, go to:<br><a href="http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=68187&atid=520347">http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=68187&atid=520347</a><br>To keep track of what is happening to your bug report you may want to register as a Source Forge user.</p>

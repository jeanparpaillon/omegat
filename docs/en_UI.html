<P CLASS="western">The user interface of OmegaT consists chiefly of
the main OmegaT window and the Match and Glossary Viewer window.</P>
<P CLASS="western">The main OmegaT window displays the text currently
being translated. The target or source texts of each segment are
displayed, depending upon whether they have been translated or not.
The exception is the active segment, of which both source and target
text is displayed: the source text in bold, the target text bracketed
by &lt;segment number&gt; and &lt;end segment&gt; tags. 
</P>
<P CLASS="western">The Match and Glossary Viewer window is divided
into two panes. The Match pane displays fuzzy matches (previously
translated segments with a certain degree of similarity to the active
segment). The Glossary pane displays information from the glossary
file, if there is one.</P>
<P CLASS="western">No other windows need normally be open. The
Project Files window, which contains a list of files for translation
within the current project together with the number of segments in
each file, can be left open if desired.</P>
<P CLASS="western">All functions are available through the menu bar
at the top of the main OmegaT window. Most functions are also
available through keyboard shortcuts.</P><br><P><A HREF="en_OmegaT.html">Return to index</A></P>

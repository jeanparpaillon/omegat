<H1 CLASS="western">Project files and directories</H1>
<H2 CLASS="western">Summary of project files and directories</H2>
<P CLASS="western">An OmegaT project comprises the following files
and directories:</P>
<P CLASS="western">A main project directory. This directory is
created when the project is created. It has the name given to it by
the user.</P>
<P CLASS="text-body-indent-western"><I>omegat.project.</I> When the
project is created, OmegaT automatically creates this file and places
it in this directory. To open a project in OmegaT, you must open its
<I>omegat.project</I> file.</P>
<P CLASS="text-body-indent-western"><I>&lt;projectname&gt;.tmx</I>.
This is the translation memory exported by the project. OmegaT
creates it automatically and places it in this directory each time
you compile the project. Note that this translation memory only
contains segments from the project at the time it was last compiled.
It does not import segments from any translation memory files in the
<I>/tm</I> directory. .</P>
<P CLASS="western">Directory <I>/source</I>. Place any files you wish
to translate in this directory after creating your project and before
opening it. Any files in this directory and subdirectories below it
are included in the project for translation, provided their format is
supported and they have the corresponding file extension.</P>
<P CLASS="text-body-indent-western"><I>*.txt</I>, <I>*.xhtml, *.html</I>,
<I>*.sxw:</I> source files imported into the project for translation.
Files with other extensions can also be imported if their extensions
are mapped to the default extensions.</P>
<P CLASS="text-body-indent-western">Files in <I>/source</I> which are
not imported into the project are transferred unchanged to <I>/target</I>
when you compile the project. This enables complete web sites in
<I>/source</I> to be mirrored in <I>/target</I>, together with their
image files in formats such as GIF or JPEG. 
</P>
<P CLASS="western">Directory <I>/glossary</I>. Place a <A HREF="en_Gloss.html">glossary</A>
which you wish to use in this directory after creating the project. 
</P>
<P CLASS="text-body-indent-western"><I>*.tab</I>: glossary files.</P>
<P CLASS="western">Directory <I>/omegat</I>. OmegaT automatically
places the following files in this directory at creation:</P>
<P CLASS="text-body-indent-western"><I>file_e<SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: none"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: none"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: none">xtension_mapping:</SPAN></SPAN></SPAN></I><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: none"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: none"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: none">
OmegaT detects file types on the basis of their extensions;
StarOffice files, for example, must have the extension .sxw in order
to be recognized. You can force OmegaT to recognize files with
different extensions (but not formats!) by editing this file. </SPAN></SPAN></SPAN>
</P>
<P CLASS="text-body-indent-western" STYLE="text-decoration: none"><I>project_save.tmx:</I>
this file is created when the project is saved for the first time. It
is in TMX format and is the working translation memory for the
project.</P>
<P CLASS="text-body-indent-western"><I><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: none">word</SPAN>_counts:
</I>this file contains two word counts of the complete project: one
including and one excluding 100% matches.</P>
<P CLASS="western">Directory <I>/target</I>. OmegaT places the
translated files into this directory at compilation.</P>
<P CLASS="text-body-indent-western"><I>*.txt, *.xhtml, *.html, *.sxw</I>:
translated files<BR>Non-translated files transferred from <I>/source</I>
at compilation</P>
<P CLASS="western">Directory <I>/tm</I>. Place any <A HREF="en_TMFormats.html">translation
memories</A> you wish to use in this directory after creating/before
loading the project. Note: regardless of whether you use previous
memories or not, OmegaT creates a working translation memory for the
project, <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: none"><I>project_save.tmx</I>,
in <I>/omegat</I> when the project is saved, and also places an
export translation memory </SPAN>in the root directory when the
project is compiled.</P>
<P CLASS="text-body-indent-western"><I>*.tmx</I>: translation memory
files created during previous projects. <I>*.tmx</I> files must be in
TMX Level 1 format.</P>
<H2 CLASS="western">Changing the location of project files and
directories</H2>
<P CLASS="western">The project directories are created when you
create a project. By default, they are all grouped under the project
root directory, but you can choose alternative locations for them by
clicking on the <I>Browse</I> button. You can therefore keep
translation memories in a particular directories, for example, and
select the desired directory when you create each new project rather
than having to copy the translation memory file into the newly
created <I>/tm</I> directory.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="font-style: normal">To change the location
of directories retrospectively, i.e. those of an existing project,
delete the directory concerned. (Do not do this whilst the project is
open.) When the project is next opened, OmegaT detects that some
directories are missing, and presents you with the directory
selection dialog in which you can select the new locations.</P><br><P><A HREF="en_OmegaT.html">Return to index</A></P>

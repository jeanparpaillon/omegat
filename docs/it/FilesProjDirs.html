<p>OmegaT works with three types of files.</p>
<dl><dt>Translation project files</dt><dd>They constitute a translation project. Loosing them may affect the project's integrity and your ability to complete a job. Project files are the most important files in OmegaT. They are the files you will deal with on a daily basis while translating.</dd>
<dt>User setting files</dt><dd>They are created when OmegaT's behavior is modified by user accessible preference settings. Loosing them will usually result in having OmegaT work with "factory" settings. This can sometimes cause a little trouble when you are in the middle of a translation.</dd>
<dt>Application files</dt><dd>They are included in the package you download, most of them are necessary to have OmegaT function properly. If for some reason such files are lost, just download and/or reinstall OmegaT to restore them all.</dd></dl>


<a name="14.1"></a>
<h2 name="14.1" id="14.1">Translation project files</h2>

<p>An OmegaT translation project is comprised of a number of files and directories.</p>

<a name="14.1.1"></a>
<h3 name="14.1.1" id="14.1.1">Translation project files location</h3>

<p>When you create a translation project, OmegaT automatically creates a list of directories that will later serve as files repositories, as well as a number of files that will be used to set some project preferences and to keep the project translation emory.</p>
<p>By default, a translation project directories are all grouped under the main project directory. Alternate locations for the directories can be chosen at project creation or during the translation. This way it is possible to select existing directories or create directories in locations that reflect your workflow habbits.</p>
<p>To change the location of directories after a project has been created open <strong>Project &gt; Properties...</strong> and do the necessary modifications. See <a href="InstantStart.html#4.2.1">Create and open a new project</a> and <a href="UserInterface.html#5.7">Project properties window</a> for related information.</p>

<a name="14.1.2"></a>
<h3 name="14.1.2" id="14.1.2">Translation project files list</h3>

<p>From a file browser, a translation project looks like just any other directory. From OmegaT dialogs, a translation project looks like a file with an OmegaT icon associated to it. OmegaT does not need to enter the hierarchy of the project to open it. Selecting the item with the OmegaT icon is enough.

<p>A translation project created with the default settings will have the following structure:</p>

<dl><dt>Project_Name/</dt>
	<dd><dl><dt>omegat/</dt><dd>
		<dl><dt>project_save.tmx</dt><dd>This TMX file is created when the project is saved for the first time. This serves as the working translation memory for the project. With the autosave function implemented, it will be automatically updated when you quit. It is the translation memory used to create the translated files.</dd>
		<dt>project_save.tmx.bak</dt><dd>This TMX file is created each time a project is reopened. It serves as a backup of <strong>project_save.tmx</strong> and is updated each time you reopen a project to reflect the contents of <strong>project_save.tmx</strong>, before any possible change has modified this file.</dd></dl></dd>
	<dt>source/</dt><dd>Files to be included into the project for translation. It is possible to put directories including files or other directories here. See <a href="FilesSourceDoc">Source document files</a> for complete information.</dd>
	<dt>target/</dt><dd>When <strong>Project > Create Target Documents</strong> is selected while a project is opened, all the files in <strong>/source</strong>, translated or not, will be reproduced here with the same directory hierarchy to reflect the current state of the translation. Practically speaking, OmegaT merges the translation information saved in <strong>omegat/project_save.tmx</strong> with the source documents to produce the <strong>target/</strong> contents.</dd>
	<dt>tm/</dt><dd>Any external translation memories to be used are placed in this directory before loading a project. See <a href="./FilesTMGloss.html#16.1">Translation memories</a> for more information.</dd>
	<dt>glossary/</dt><dd>Contains glossary files to be used, if any. The user must place glossary files in this directory before opening a project. See <a href="./FilesTMGloss.html#16.2">Glossary files</a> for more information.</dd>
	<dl><dt>omegat.project</dt><dd>OmegaT automatically creates this file when the project is created. It contains the project parameters. The parameters included in this file can be modified from the <a href="UserInterface.html#5.7">Project properties window</a>.</dd>
	<dt>Project_Name.tmx</dt><dd>This is the translation memory exported by the project. It is automatically updated each time the project is compiled. It is automatically created by OmegaT and has the same name as the project name.</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>


<a name="14.2"></a>
<h2 name="14.2" id="14.2">User files</h2>

<a name="14.2.1"></a>
<h3 name="14.2.1" id="14.2.1">User files location</h3>

<p>Starting with OmegaT 1.6, user files are stored in a separate location where they can be accessed by any version of OmegaT. The location depends on the platform you use:</p>

<dl><dt>On Windows:</dt><dd><strong>C:\Documentation and Settings\&lt;User Name&gt;\Application Data\OmegaT</strong>. The bit before &lt;User Name&gt; might be different on some systems, but usually it's there. The entire application data path is retrieved through the environment variable %APPDATA%.</dd>
<dt>On Linux/Solaris/FreeBSD:</dt><dd><strong>&lt;User Home&gt;/.omegat</strong> (.omegat is a directory, the dot preceeding its name makes it invisible unless you type <code>ls -a</code> or an equivalent command.)</dd>
<dt>On MacOSX:</dt><dd><strong>&lt;User Home&gt;/Library/Preferences/OmegaT</strong></dd></dl>

<p>It's very easy to add more UNIX-es or other types of platforms, so if you run anything else than the platforms named above, please say so.</p>

<a name="14.2.2"></a>
<h3 name="14.2.2" id="14.2.2">User files list</h3>

<p>User files are:<p>

<dl><dt>log.txt</dt><dd>This file records Java error messages while OmegaT is running. When you think OmegaT is behaving erratically it is important to include this file or the relevant part in any trouble report. See <a href="Important.html#3.2">Error logging</a> and <a href="Important.html#3.3">Bug reports</a> for related information.</dd>
<dt>omegat.prefs</dt><dd>This file is an xml file. It includes all the GUI accessible option settings, as well as window position data. See <a href="UserInterface.html#5">User interface</a> for related information.</dd>
<dt>filters.conf</dt><dd>This file is an xml file. It includes all the data set by the file filters preferences. See <a href="Filters.html#13">File filters</a> for related information.</dd>
<dt>segmentation.conf</dt><dd>This file is an xml file. It includes all the data set by the sentence segmentation preferences. See <a href="SentSeg.html#9">Sentence segmentation</a> for related information.</dd></dl>

<a name="14.3"></a>
<h2 name="14.3" id="14.3">Application files</h2>

<p>OmegaT comes as a package you can download from SourceForge. In this chapter we will consider the platform independant package that contains the application in a standard Java form. Other packages include a Windows installer, a MacOSX installer and a source code package for developers.</p>

<p>The platform independant package comes as a compressed file that you need to decompress in the directory of your choice for install. Decompression is usually done by double clicking on the downloaded package. Once decompressed, a directory containing OmegaT related files will be created:</p>

<dl><dt>Downloaded file:</dt><dd>OmegaT_1.6.zip</dd>
<dt>Decompressed directory:</dt><dd>OmegaT_1.6/</dd></dl>

<a name="14.3.1"></a>
<h3 name="14.3.1" id="14.3.1">Application files list</h3>

<p>The OmegaT directory will contain the following files:</p>

<dl>
<dt>OmegaT_1.6/</dt>
	<dd><dl><dt>docs/</dt><dd>All the user manual files are in this directory. You can open them in an internet browser to have access to external links.</dl></dd>
	<dd><dl><dt>images/</dt><dd>Icons and logo graphics are included here.</dd></dl></dd>
	<dd><dl><dt>lib/</dt><dd>Java files are inlcuded here. They are necessary to the well functionning of OmegaT.</dd></dl></dd>
	<dd><dl><dt>lib-mnemonics.jar</dt><dd>This file is a Java file used to include "mnemonics" in the menu or GUI items for direct keyboard access. It is necessary to the well functionning of OmegaT even on platforms where it is not used (MacOSX for example).</dd></dl></dd>
	<dd><dl><dt>join.html</dt><dd>This is a normal html file that once opened in your internet browser will redirect you to the OmegaT user group hosted on Yahoo Groups. Joining is not necessary but will give you access to some extra services like access to some files and irregular polls, besides for being able to join in OmegaT related discussions. The group archives are public and consultation does not require subscribtion to the group.</dd></dl></dd>
	<dd><dl><dt>changes.txt</dt><dd>A relatively detailed list of modifications between this version and the preceding versions.</dd></dl></dd>
	<dd><dl><dt>license.txt</dt><dd>The GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE. This license allows you to do certain things with OmegaT, including modifying and distributing it. If you are interested in modifying or distributing OmegaT, take a good look at this document and make sure you are aware of all its implications before doing anything. In case you are in doubt, don't hesitate to ask project members directly either by sending them a mail from the Source Forge page or by sending a public mail to the user group.</dd></dl></dd>
	<dd><dl><dt>readme.txt</dt><dd>This file is very important and you should make sure you read it before starting OmegaT. It includes general information about OmegaT, where to find more information, how to contribute etc.</dd></dl></dd>
	<dd><dl><dt>OmegaT</dt><dd>This is a normal text file that contains only one line: <code>java -jar OmegaT.jar</code>. You may find this file useful if you make it executable (<code>chmod +x OmegaT</code>) from the command line after making sure you are in the <code>OmegaT_1.6/</code> directory. From now on you'll be able to start OmegaT by calling this file from the command line. See <a href="InstallConfig.html#2.4.1">OmegaT Configuration (Unix)</a> for related information.</dd></dl></dd>
	<dd><dl><dt>OmegaT.bat</dt><dd>This is a normal text file that contains only one line: <code>java -jar OmegaT.jar</code>. It is used to launch OmegaT from the Windows command line.</dd></dl></dd>
	<dd><dl><dt>OmegaT.jar</dt><dd>This file is the main application. To launch OmegaT you have to either call this file from the command line or launch it from your file manager (usually by double-clicking it).</dd></dl></dd></dl>

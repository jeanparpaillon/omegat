    <h1 align="center">Segmentation</h1>

    <p>
      When a project is opened the text goes through a pre-segmentation process 
      before being displayed in the editor window. During this process segment 
      boundaries are set and cannot be changed afterwards from within OmegaT 
      (during translation). 
    </p>

    <p>
      If bad segmentation occurs in a file, close the project, modify the file
      responsible, and then reopen the project.
    </p>

    <p>
      Segmentation in OmegaT depends on the file types in a project. 
    </p>
    
    <h3>Text Files</h3>

    <p>
      Segmentation for text files in OmegaT occurs at line breaks. Line breaks 
      are sometimes found at the end of sentences and sometimes at the end of paragraphs.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Paragraph-level segments, sentence-level segments, or segments that include 
      parts of sentences will be created depending upon how your text file is formatted.
      Therefore, it is possible to force segmentation at any level desired by the
      insertion of line breaks in a file before starting work on a project.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      It could be worthwhile to edit source text prior to opening a project if it 
      contains manual line breaks, carriage returns, or other formatting at 
      inconvenient locations which may lead to bad segmentation or a disorganized
      presentation. An external text editor or wordprocessor (e.g. OpenOffice.org) 
      can be used for this purpose. To see any changes made in this way the project
      must be reloaded.
    </p>
   
    <h3>Tagged (Formatted) Files</h3>

    <p>
      Relevant tagged files in OmegaT include: HTML, XHTML, OpenDocument, OpenOffice.org, 
      and StarOffice. In general, these files contain two types of tags:
    </p>
    
    <ul>
      <li>
        in line&#8211;usually defines the style of the text;
      </li>
      <li>   
        block level&#8211;usually describes its logical structure.
      </li>
    </ul>  

    <p>
      Segmentation in formatted files occurs at block level tags.
    </p>

    <p>
      To use sentence level segmentation in tagged files there are OpenOffice.org 
      conversion macros available. These macros convert sentences (stylistic units)
      in OpenDocument/OpenOffice.org files to paragraphs (logical units) so that 
      when a file is opened in OmegaT it is segmented by sentence instead of by
      paragraph. Go to the website (http://www.omegat.org/omegat/omegat.html) to
      download them.
      
      <!--<a href="http://www.omegat.org/omegat/omegat.html">OmegaT</a>-->       
    </p>
    
    <h3>Other File Types</h3>

    <p>
      In addition to text files and tagged files, OmegaT 1.4.4 also supports Java 
      Resource Bundle files. These files use one line per language item (character
      string) to be translated. The segmentation is very similar to that of text
      files, except that there is no need to modify the file's formatting.
    </p>

    <h3>Notes</h3>

    <p>
      It was previously believed, and indicated in older versions of this manual,
      that OmegaT segments by the paragraph. This is incorrect. The logical structure
      of a file determines how segmentation is delimited. Also note that punctuation
      marks (. ! ; and so on) are not considered delimiters.
    </p>
    
    <p>  
      The context used in regard to segmentation is only applicable to written
      text. It cannot be taken to apply to elements of spreadsheets, tables, visual
      presentations, or other non-textual formats. Text elements in a spreadsheet, 
      a table or a visual presentation, among other documents a translator usually 
      works with, are logically structured at what CAT tool users call the "sentence"
      level. In such a context, OmegaT's segmentation will reflect the original 
      sentence level structure. For such documents, very common in the translation
      industry, distinction between paragraph and sentence is not relevant anymore.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      If the segmentation of a file is not satisfactory it will be necessary to 
      alter it outside of OmegaT before working on a project.

<H2 CLASS="western">OpenOffice.org and StarOffice: the difference</H2>
<P CLASS="western">OpenOffice.org and StarOffice are, broadly
speaking, the same program. OpenOffice.org is open-source, meaning
essentially that it is free, and can be copied freely. StarOffice is
a commercial product: you must buy a licence for each system on which
you intend to use it. StarOffice contains certain components which
are not present in OpenOffice.org; purchasing a licence also entitles
you to technical support. For the purpose of this manual, all
references to OpenOffice.org apply equally to StarOffice.</P>
<H2 CLASS="western">OpenOffice.org and OmegaT</H2>
<P CLASS="western">OmegaT is a standalone application. It does not
require OpenOffice.org or StarOffice, MS Word, or any other word
processor. 
</P>
<P CLASS="western">OpenOffice.org/StarOffice do however extend
OmegaT's functionality considerably, as they enable it to handle
files in formats which it does not support directly. In particular,
these include MS Word, MS Excel, MS Powerpoint and RTF. To prepare
files in these formats for processing in OmegaT, simply open them in
OpenOffice.org and save them in the native OpenOffice.org format.
When you have finished your translation, open them in OpenOffice.org
again and save them in the original format.</P>
<P CLASS="western">OpenOffice.org/StarOffice also add further
functionality to the core functions of OmegaT. Spellchecking and
sentence-level rather than paragraph-level segmenting are two
functions not provided in OmegaT itself but made possible with
OpenOffice.org.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="font-style: normal; text-decoration: none"><FONT COLOR="#330000"><FONT FACE="Nimbus Sans L">Use
OpenOffice.org 1.0/StarOffice 6.0 or later in conjunction with
OmegaT. Earlier builds/versions (e.g. the OpenOffice.org Beta) may
not work. StarOffice 5.2 will certainly <B>not</B> work.</FONT></FONT></P>
<H2 CLASS="western">Hints and tips</H2>
<P CLASS="western">Make sure that MS Word files have not been saved
with the "Fast Save" option, or OpenOffice.org will
probably be unable to read them.</P>
<P CLASS="western">Don't attempt to load OpenOffice.org files saved
with the "Revision" function (i.e. "Record
changes") active into OmegaT. Disable the function and accept
all the changes first. This problem is most likely to occur when you
receive MS Word files which have been saved with the "Revision"
function enabled, and you are not aware of the fact. OpenOffice.org
supports this function (which is in fact very useful), but it should
not be used in conjunction with OmegaT.</P>
<P CLASS="western">Obtain and install the spellcheck tools
OpenOffice.org for your target language(s). Then, before loading a
project containing OpenOffice.org files for the first time, open
these files in OpenOffice.org and change the language of the text to
your target language by marking the whole text with <I>Ctrl-A</I>,
then <I>Format</I> &gt; <I>Character</I> &gt; <I>Language</I>. You
can then use OpenOffice.org to spellcheck your finished translation
after compilation. You can change the language after compiling, but
if you compile more than once the language will revert to that of the
source text file each time.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="font-weight: medium">After compiling an
OpenOffice.org-format text for the last time, check that everything
has been translated. You will probably want to open the file in
OpenOffice.org in any case, in order to spell-check it. You may also
find however that OmegaT may miss parts of the text, such as headers
and footers. 
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="font-weight: medium">Should OpenOffice.org
fail to open a translated file and return an error, you have probably
damaged tags by mistake during the translation process. In this case,
open the project again and use the Validate tags function to locate
the affected segment(s).</P><br><P><A HREF="en_OmegaT.html">Return to index</A></P>

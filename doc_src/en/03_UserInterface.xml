          <secondary>Editor pane</secondary>
        </indexterm></title>

      <para>This is where you type and edit your translation. The Editor pane
      displays the text of the partially translated document: the text already
      translated is displayed translated, the untranslated text is displayed
      in the original language. The displayed text is split into segments, and
      you may scroll through the document and double-click on any segment to
      open and edit it. In the above case, the segments already translated are
      shown in yellow, but you may change the setup to suit your preferences
      (see <xref linkend="submenu.View" />).</para>

      <para>One of the segments is the current segment. It is the segment that
      is displayed in two parts. The upper part is in the original language,
      in bold characters with a green background color, the lower part is the
      editing field, delimited by two markers: <indexterm class="singular">
          <primary>Segment marker</primary>
        </indexterm>the leftmost marker is <literal>&lt;segment
      nnnn&gt;</literal> where nnnn is a number of the segment in the project,
      the rightmost marker is <literal>&lt;end segment&gt;.</literal> Use the
      upper part as a reference and replace or modify the contents of the
      editing field with your translation.</para>

      <para>Depending upon the preferred editing behaviour, the editing field
      for the untranslated segment may be empty, contain the source text, or
      contain the translation of the string most similar to the one to be
      translated. When you move to another segment, the translation is
      validated and stored. If you want the translation to be the same as the
      source, simply make the editing field empty by removing all the text
      (select all with <keycap>Ctrl+A</keycap> and delete with
      <keycap>Del</keycap>). OmegaT is able to store translations that are
      identical to the source. This is useful for documents that contain trade
      marks, names or other proper nouns, or parts in a third language that do
      not require translation. See <emphasis>Translation editing</emphasis>
      for more details.</para>

      <para>If you rightclick on the Editor pane, a pop-up menu opens,

      <para>Match viewer shows the most similar segments from translation
      memories, both from internal project translation memory created
      progressively as you translate your project, from ancillary translation
      memories you have imported from your earlier jobs, or received from your
      client or translation agency.</para>

      <para>When you move to the next segment, the first fuzzy match (the one
      with the best matching percentage) is automatically selected. You may
      select a different match by pressing <guimenuitem>Ctrl+2, 3, 4, or
      5</guimenuitem>.<indexterm>
          <primary>Shortcuts</primary>

          <secondary>Ctrl+N - Selecting the match</secondary>
        </indexterm> Of course, pressing <keycombo>
          <keycap>Ctrl</keycap>

          <keycap>5</keycap>
        </keycombo> will have no effect, if there is no match #5.To use the
      selected match in your translation, use
      <guimenuitem>Ctrl+R</guimenuitem><indexterm class="singular">
          <primary>Shortcuts</primary>

          <secondary>Ctrl+R - Replace text</secondary>
        </indexterm> to replace the target field with the match or use
      <guimenuitem>Ctrl+I <indexterm class="singular">
          <primary>Shortcuts</primary>

          <secondary>Ctrl+I - Insert text</secondary>
        </indexterm></guimenuitem> to insert it at the cursor position.</para>

      <para>The matching percentage is roughly equivalent to taking the number
      of common words in the matched and the matching segment and dividing by
      the number of words in the longest of the two. The selected fuzzy match
      is highlighted in bold, words that are missing in the segment you
      translate is colored blue and words adjacent to the missing parts green.
      In the above example the source segment is <emphasis
      role="bold">Information about Java &amp;
      <application>OmegaT</application></emphasis>. The top match is 75%,
      because 1 out of 4 words – Information – does not match. The line with
      the matching percentage also includes the name of the translation memory

      treated as being different)</para>

      <para>The difference between "Number of segments" and "Number of unique
      segments" provides an approximate idea of the number of repetitions in
      the text. Note however that the numbers do not indicate how relevant the
      repetitions are: they could mean relatively long sentences repeated a
      number of times (in which case you are fortunate) or it could describe a
      table of keywords (not so fortunate). The
      <filename>project_stats.txt</filename> located in the omegat folder of
      your project contains more detailed segment information, broken down by
      file. .</para>

      <para>Modifying the segmentation rules may have the effect of modifying
      the number of segments/unique segments. This, however, should generally
      be avoided once you have started translating the project. See the
      chapter <emphasis>Segmentation rules</emphasis> for more

      <para>The tags are highlighted in bold blue for easy comparison between

      the segment in the Editor pane. Correct the error if necessary and press
      <guimenuitem>Ctrl+T</guimenuitem> to return to the tag validation window
      to correct other errors. In the first and third case above tags are
      paired incorrectly, and in the second case the &lt; sign is missing from
      the starting tag.</para>

      <para>Tag errors are cases in which the tags in the translation do not
      correspond in order and number to the original segment. Some tag
      scenarios flagged in the tag validation window are necessary and are
      benign, others will cause problems when the translated document is
      created. Tags generally represent some kind of formatting in the
      original text. Simplifying the original text formatting in the source
      file before commencing translation greatly contributes to reducing the
      number of tags.</para>

      Statistics.</guimenuitem> The evaluation is rather CPU intensive and can
      be time-consuming, so a progress bar is shown during the calculation. As
      far as categories are concerned, the de facto industry standard of
      classifying matches into the following groups is used:</para>

      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para>Exact match</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>

          <para>No match</para>
        </listitem>
      </itemizedlist>

      <para>The word counts are identical to the numbers, provided in the
      Project Files window, and are based strictly on the OmegaT's method of
      counting, with a few differences in terminology to account for concept
      differences. This information is computed for segments, words and for
      characters (without and including spaces). Note that these totals are a
      good (or as-good-as-it-can-get) approximation of the work involved in
      the project and thus can serve as a basis for your cost and price
      calculations.</para>

      <para>Spaces between segments are not taken into account in the last
      column. Repetitions stand for identical segments present several times
      in the text. The first segment and its contents will be classified as
      "no match", and the rest of them as a repetition of the first. If the
      translation for several identical source segments already exists in the
      translation memory of the project, these segments, together with other,
      already translated unique segments, will be classified as "Exact match".
      The number of unique segments, if needed, is provided in the standard
      statistics window, regardless of whether they have been translated or
      not.</para>

      <para>The rest of the categories (50-100%) involves untranslated
      segments with a fuzzy match. Fuzzy matches can come from the
      <filename>/tm</filename> folder as well - and not just from the internal
      translation memory in <filename>/omegaT,</filename> as is the case for
      repetitions and exact matches. The only difference with matches from
      <filename>project_save</filename> translation memory is that external
      TMs cannot give exact matches, only 100%. If one does not wish to use
      external TMs for counting, one will either have to empty the /tm folder
      or change the project setup (temporarily) so that the value for /tm
      points to a different location.</para>

      data also available in

      is time-stamped, as the calculation (contrary to the standard
      statistics) is not instantaneous and can thus quickly become

  <title>About <application>OmegaT - introduction</application></title>

  <para><application>OmegaT</application> is a free multi platform Computer
  Aided Translation tool, with the following highlights:</para>

  <itemizedlist>
    <listitem>
      <para><emphasis role="bold">Translation memory:</emphasis><application>OmegaT</application> memorizes your
      translations in a translation memory. At the same time it can use
      memories from previous translations for reference. Translation memories
      can be very useful for a translation with a number of repetitions or
      reasonably similar segments of text. <application>OmegaT</application>
      uses translation memories to remember your previous translations and
      suggest to you the most probable translations for the text you are
      working on</para>

      <para>The translation memories can be very useful when a document,
      that's been already translated, needs to be updated. Unchanged sentences
      will remain as translated, and updated sentences will be shown with an
      older version of the same sentence as the most probable translation.
      Modifications to the original document will thus be handled with greater
      ease. If you are using previously created translation memories, for
      example given to you by translation agency or your client,
      <application>OmegaT</application> will be able to use them as a
      reference memories.</para>

      <para><application>OmegaT</application> uses the standard TMX file
      format to store and access translation memories, which guarantees that
      you can exchange your translation material with other CAT applications,
      supporting this file format.</para>

  </itemizedlist>

  <itemizedlist>
    <listitem>
      <para><emphasis role="bold">Terminology management</emphasis>:Terminology management is important for translation
      consistency. <application>OmegaT</application> uses glossaries that
      contain translations of single words or small phrases, a sort of
      simplified bilingual dictionary for a specific domain.
      <application>OmegaT</application> displays the translation of those
      words that happen to be present in the current segment for your
      reference.</para>

  </itemizedlist>

  <itemizedlist>
    <listitem>
      <para><emphasis role="bold">Translation process:</emphasis> Imagine
      having to translate anything from a single file to a folder that
      contains subfolders with a number of files in a variety of formats. When
      you let <application>OmegaT</application> know that you need to
      translate those files it will look for the included files it supports
      according to the file filtering rules, recognize the textual parts in
      them, split the biggest text groups according to the segmentation rules
      and display the segments one by one so that you can proceed with the
      translation. <application>OmegaT</application> will memorize your
      translations and will propose you translation candidates for segments
      similar to those recorded in memory. Once you want to see how the files
      would look once translated, you can create the translated files open
      them in the appropriate application and see what your translation looks
      like.</para>

  <para>This documentation is intended both as a starter guide and as a
  reference guide.</para>

  <para>The chapter I - is intended as a short introduction for beginners and
  it shows the complete way from opening a new translation project to the
  finished translation, the following chapters - II. User interface and III.

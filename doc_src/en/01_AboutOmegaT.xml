    <para><application>OmegaT</application> is a free multi platform Computer
    Aided Translation tool, with the following highlights:</para>

      <listitem>
        <para><emphasis role="bold">Translation
        memory:</emphasis><application> OmegaT</application> memorizes your
        translations in a translation memory. At the same time it can use
        memories from previous translations for reference. Translation
        memories can be very useful for a translation with a number of
        repetitions or reasonably similar segments of text.
        <application>OmegaT</application> uses translation memories to
        remember your previous translations and suggest to you the most
        probable translations for the text you are working on</para>

        <para>The translation memories can be very useful when a document,
        that's been already translated, needs to be updated. Unchanged
        sentences will remain as translated, and updated sentences will be
        shown with an older version of the same sentence as the most probable
        translation. Modifications to the original document will thus be
        handled with greater ease. If you are using previously created
        translation memories, for example given to you by translation agency
        or your client, <application>OmegaT</application> will be able to use
        them as a reference memories.</para>

        <para><application>OmegaT</application> uses the standard TMX file
        format to store and access translation memories, which guarantees that
        you can exchange your translation material with other CAT
        applications, supporting this file format.</para>

      <listitem>
        <para><emphasis role="bold">Terminology
        management</emphasis>:Terminology management is important for
        translation consistency. <application>OmegaT</application> uses
        glossaries that contain translations of single words or small phrases,
        a sort of simplified bilingual dictionary for a specific domain.
        <application>OmegaT</application> displays the translation of those
        words that happen to be present in the current segment for your
        reference.</para>

    </itemizedlist>

    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para><emphasis role="bold">Translation process:</emphasis> Imagine
        having to translate anything from a single file to a folder that
        contains subfolders with a number of files in a variety of formats.
        When you let <application>OmegaT</application> know that you need to
        translate those files it will look for the included files it supports
        according to the file filtering rules, recognize the textual parts in
        them, split the biggest text groups according to the segmentation
        rules and display the segments one by one so that you can proceed with
        the translation. <application>OmegaT</application> will memorize your
        translations and will propose you translation candidates for segments
        similar to those recorded in memory. Once you want to see how the
        files would look once translated, you can create the translated files
        open them in the appropriate application and see what your translation
        looks like.</para>

        segmentation. A number of rules is already available, however,

        can be more involved, for instance, when proofreading the target text:

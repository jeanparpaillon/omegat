    Aided Translation tool, with the following highlights:</para>

    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para><emphasis role="bold">Translation
        memory:</emphasis><application> </application>OmegaT memorizes your
        translations in a translation memory. At the same time it can use
        memories from previous translations for reference. Translation
        memories can be very useful for a translation with a number of
        repetitions or reasonably similar segments of text. OmegaT uses
        translation memories to remember your previous translations and
        suggest to you likely translations for the text you are working
        on.</para>

        <para>The translation memories can be very useful when a document that
        has already been translated needs to be updated. Unchanged sentences
        are automatically translated, updated sentences are shown with the
        translation of the most similar older sentence. Modifications to the
        original document are thus handled with greater ease. If you are
        supplied with translation memories created previously, for example by
        your translation agency or your client, OmegaT is able to use them as
        a reference memories.</para>

        <para>OmegaT uses the standard tmx file format to store and access
        translation memories, which guarantees that you can exchange your
        translation material with other CAT applications supporting this file
        format.</para>

    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para><emphasis role="bold">Terminology
        management</emphasis>: Terminology management is important for
        translation consistency. OmegaT uses glossaries containing
        translations of single words or small phrases: a simplified bilingual
        dictionary for a specific domain. For your reference, OmegaT displays
        the translation of any words that happen to be present in the current
        segment.</para>

    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para><emphasis role="bold">Translation process:</emphasis> imagine
        having to translate something, from a single file to a folder
        containing subfolders each with a number of files in a variety of
        formats. When you let OmegaT know the files that you need to
        translate, it looks for the files it is able to handle according to
        the file filtering rules, recognizes the textual parts within them,
        splits up the text groups according to the segmentation rules, and
        displays the segments one by one so that you can proceed with the
        translation. OmegaT memorizes your translations and proposes possible
        translations from similar segments in the memory. When you wish to see
        how the files look once translated, you can create the translated
        files, open them in the appropriate application and view the
        translation in the final format..</para>

        tools work with textual units called segments. In OmegaT, segments can
        be based on paragraphs or on segmentation rules. Paragraph
        segmentation is less frequently used, but can be useful in cases of
        so-called "creative" texts, The rule-based segmentation is usually
        synonymous with sentence-based segmentation. A number of rule sets are
        provided and on top of them additional rules can be defined by the
        user, as described in this chapter.</para>

        'kangaroo' in the source". </emphasis> They can also be complex,
        allowing for instance to search for segments in which the target text
        contains two or more consecutive spaces. In the second example the
        regular expression ^s^s+ will find and list the offending segments.
        Regular expressions are also used extensively in the segmentation

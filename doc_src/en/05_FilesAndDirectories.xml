  <para><application>OmegaT</application> works with three types of
  files.</para>

  <itemizedlist>
    <listitem>
      <para>Translation project files: They constitute a translation project.
      Loosing them may affect the project's integrity and your ability to
      complete a job. Project files are the most important files in
      <application>OmegaT</application>. They are the files you will deal with
      on a daily basis while translating.</para>
    </listitem>
  </itemizedlist>

  <itemizedlist>
    <listitem>
      <para>User setting files: They are created when
      <application>OmegaT</application>'s behavior is modified by user
      accessible preference settings. Loosing them will usually result in
      having <application>OmegaT</application> work with "factory" settings.
      This can sometimes cause a little trouble when you are in the middle of
      a translation.</para>
    </listitem>
  </itemizedlist>

  <itemizedlist>
    <listitem>
      <para>Application files: They are included in the package you download,
      most of them are necessary to have <application>OmegaT</application>
      function properly. If for some reason such files are lost, just download
      and/or reinstall <application>OmegaT</application> to restore them
      all.</para>

  <section id="translation.project.files">
    <title>Translation project files</title>

    <para>An <application>OmegaT</application> translation project consists of
    a number of files and directories.</para>

    <section id="translation.project.files.location">

          <primary>Project files</primary>

          <secondary>Location</secondary>
        </indexterm>Translation project files location</title>

      <para>When you create a translation project,
      <application>OmegaT</application> automatically creates a list of
      directories that will later serve as files repositories, as well as a
      number of files that will be used to set some project preferences and to
      keep the project translation memory. By default, a translation project
      directories are all grouped under the main project folder. Alternate
      locations for the directories can be chosen at project creation or
      during the translation. This way it is possible to select existing
      directories or create directories in locations that reflect your work
      flow habits. To change the location of directories after a project has
      been created, open <menuchoice>

        </indexterm>Translation project files list</title>

      <para>In a file dialog opened by <application>OmegaT</application>, a
      translation project will look like a file with an
      <application>OmegaT</application> icon associated to it. From a file
      browser, however, the same translation project looks like just any other
      folder.</para>

          <secondary>Subfolder omegat</secondary>
        </indexterm></title>

      <para>The subfolder <emphasis role="bold">omegat </emphasis>will
      eventually contain several files, the most important among them being
      the translation memory file <filename>project_save.TMX (...)</filename>.
      The file <filename>project_save.TMX</filename> is the working
      translation memory for the project. With the autosave function
      activated, it will be automatically updated when you quit. It is the
      translation memory used to create the translated files. A number of TMX
      files with names of the form project_save.TMX.<emphasis>&lt;date and
      time&gt;.bak</emphasis> (...) will later on be added to this subfolder.
      They serve as a backup for the project TM and are being added each time
      you reopen a project, thus reflecting its contents before the current
      session has changed it.</para>

        </indexterm><emphasis role="bold">stats.txt</emphasis> file (...)
      contains the statistics about the current project and can be opened in a
      spreadsheet application to display segment and word count information.
      The file contains for each file the number of segments - Total and
      Remaining - the number of Unique segments per file, the number of Unique
      words and the number of Unique Characters with / without spaces per
      file,</para>

      <para> Note that Unique segments per file stands for the number of
      unique segments in a given file that do not appear anywhere else in the
      project. The unique words/characters per file have a similar definition.
      Note that in a multi-file project the sum of unique segments per file
      will not necessary be equal to the grand total of unique segments in the
      project. </para>

      checker. Note that they are specific for a given project, so if you have
      already amassed words you want the spell checker to ignore / accept, you
      just need to copy the corresponding two files into the<filename> omegat

      <para>The source subfolder is the space for the files to be translated.
      You can specify a new subfolder and add the files to it the project
      later as well in the project list window. Note that the structure of the
      source subfolder is completely in your hands. If the files to be
      translated are parts of a tree structure, you just need to specify the
      top subfolder and <application>OmegaT</application> will copy it all,
      while keeping the tree structure intact.</para>

    <para><application>OmegaT</application> comes as a package you can
    download from SourceForge. In this chapter we will consider the platform
    independent package that contains the application in a standard Java form.
    Other packages include a Linux .tar package, a Windows installer -with or
    without a Java Runtime Environment, a MacOSX installer and a source code
    package for developers. This platform independent package can be used on
    any platform with a running Java 1.5 runtime environment, including the
    platforms for which there is a specific package. The platform independent
    package comes as a compressed file that you need to decompress in the
    folder of your choice for install. Decompression is usually done by double
    clicking on the downloaded package. Once decompressed, a folder containing
    the following contents will be created:</para>

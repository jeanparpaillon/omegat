  <para>OmegaT has a built-in spell checker based on the spelling checker used
  in OpenOffice.org, Firefox and Thunderbird. It is consequently able to use
  the huge range of free spelling dictionaries available for these
  applications.</para>

  <section>
    <title>Installing spelling dictionaries</title>

    <para>Before the spell check function can be used, a suitable dictionary
    or dictionaries (i.e. for your target language) must be installed. To
    install spelling dictionaries, follow this procedure:</para>

    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para>In your file manager, create a new folder in a suitable location
        in which to store spelling dictionaries.</para>
      </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>

    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para>In OmegaT, select <guisubmenu><indexterm class="singular">
            <primary>Menu Options</primary>

            <secondary>Spell checking..</secondary>
          </indexterm></guisubmenu><guimenuitem>Options &gt; Spell
        Checking</guimenuitem>, then click <guibutton>Choose
        </guibutton>beside the Dictionary file folder field. Navigate to and
        select the folder you created for dictionaries.</para>
      </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>

    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para>Place the dictionary files you wish to use in this folder. There
        are essentially two ways in which you can do this. You can either copy
        files manually, i.e. from elsewhere on your system, using your file
        manager; or you can use OmegaT's <emphasis
        role="bold">"Install"</emphasis> function to provide a list of
        available dictionaries to select from. Note that the "Install"
        function requires an Internet connection. The selected languages will
        then be installed and will eventually appear in your spell checker
        setup window (this may take a while).</para>
      </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>

    <para>Copying the files manually is useful if you already have suitable
    dictionary files on your system, for instance as part of your
    OpenOffice.org or Thunderbird installation. The files you need will have
    the extensions <filename>.aff</filename> and <filename>.dic</filename>,
    and you need both files in order for the dictionary in question to work.
    You can use these file extensions to search your desktop for suitable
    dictionaries. In the case below, no extra folder has been created and no
    copying of files was necessary, as the OpenOffice.org dictionary folder is
    used instead:</para>

    <figure id="spellchecker.setup">
      <title>Spell checker setup</title>

      <mediaobject>
        <imageobject role="html">
          <imagedata fileref="images/SpellcheckerSetup2.png" />
        </imageobject>
      </mediaobject>
    </figure>

    <para>Note that in the above case, you may lose the spelling dictionaries,
    if the OpenOffice.org installation is removed from your system. Creating
    your own folder and copying the files may be extra work, but possibly
    worth the trouble.</para>

    <para>More recent OpenOffice.org spelling dictionaries are supplied as
    "OpenOffice.org extensions", with the filename extension .oxt. These are
    however zip archives: if you rename the file with the extension .zip, you
    can extract the contents in a zip utility, and you will find the .aff and
    .dic files that you need, which you can then place in the folder that you
    created for them.</para>

    <para>Please note that the application behind the<guilabel>
    "Install..."</guilabel> button depends on the Internet list of
    dictionaries. If it is out of date or does not include the desired
    language, you will have to look for appropriate vocabularies yourself.
    OpenOffice.org contains probably the largest vocabulary collection at the
    <ulink
    url="http://extensions.services.openoffice.org/dictionary">OpenOffice.org
    Extensions site</ulink>. After the dictionary extension has been
    downloaded and installed, the corresponding <emphasis>aff</emphasis> and
    <emphasis>dic</emphasis> will become available. The same can be achieved
    by downloading a spell checker add-ons for Firefox or Thunderbird; in this
    case the spell checker files will be stored in your (Firefox or
    Thunderbird) profile.</para>

    <para>Make sure the language code of your target files corresponds to the
    dictionary's language code: an FR-FR dictionary will not work with an FR
    target setting. You need to change the setting to FR-FR to have the spell
    checker recognize the correct dictionary for your target. Look for files
    with the name, indicating the language used and having extensions
    <emphasis>aff</emphasis> and <emphasis>dic.</emphasis></para>
  </section>

  <section>
    <title>Using spelling dictionaries</title>

    <para>There is no need to instruct OmegaT to use a particular spelling
    dictionary; OmegaT will use the correct language dictionary based upon the
    language codes of your project. Check however that the language codes are
    exactly the same: an FR-FR dictionary will not work with an FR target
    setting, for example. If necessary, edit the file names of the dictionary
    or change your project's language settings.</para>

    <para>To enable the spell checker, select <guimenuitem>Options &gt; Spell
    Checking</guimenuitem> and tick the <guilabel>Automatically check the
    spelling of text</guilabel> checkbox (see above).</para>

    <para>Right-clicking on an underlined word (Artund in the figure above)
    opens a drop-down menu listing suggestions for the correction (Art und).
    You can also instruct the spell checker to ignore all the occurrences of
    the mis-spelled word, or add it to the dictionary.</para>

    <para>If the spell checker is not working, then make sure first that the
    check box <guilabel>"Automatically check the spelling of text"</guilabel>
    in the spell checker dialog (<guisubmenu>Options &gt; Spell
    checking...)</guisubmenu> has been ticked.</para>

    <para>Also check that the target language code of your project against the
    available vocabularies in the setup window. The spell checker uses the
    target language code to determine the language to be used : if the target
    language is Brazilian Portuguese (PT_BR), the subfolder with vocabularies
    must contain the two vocabulary files, called
    <emphasis>pt_br.aff</emphasis> and <emphasis>pt_br.dic</emphasis>.</para>

    <para>If you have already translated a large body of text, and then
    realize the target language code of the project does not match the spell
    checker's language code (you specified pt_BR as the language, but there
    are no pt_BR vocabularies, for instance) you can simply copy the two
    corresponding files and rename them (e.g. from
    <emphasis>pt_PT.arr</emphasis> and <emphasis>pt_PT.dic</emphasis> to
    <emphasis>pt._BR.arr</emphasis> and <emphasis>pt_BR.dic</emphasis>). Of
    course it is much wiser, to take a short break and download the correct
    versions of the spell checker.</para>

    <para>Note that <filename>Uninstall</filename> physically removes the
    selected vocabularies. If they are part of OpenOffice.org, as in the above
    case, they will disappear from that application, too. If, for whatever
    reason, you need to do this from time to time, it may make sense to copy
    the files involved to a different folder, reserved just for use by
    OmegaT.</para>

  <section>
    <title>Thank you all!</title>

    <para>Whatever the inconsistencies, omissions and straightforward errors
    you may find in the present version, I declare them all my own. This
    manual, however, would not be possible without the help and support from a
    number of people. Explicit thanks to:</para>

    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para>Mark Prior: correcting my first draft was an act of love for
        OmegaT and the English language.</para>
      </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>

    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para>Didier Briel: I could not do without Didier's patient and
        persistent help with DocBook intricacies. Not to mention his care and
        diligence, keeping repositories intact and in good order.</para>

    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para>Will Helton: his final reading of the draft has spared me a lot
        of embarrassment. One could only wonder, how many the and a
        prepositions would still be missing without his invaluable
        help.</para>

    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para>Jean-Cristophe Hillary: special thanks to JC for his concise
        description of OmegaT run and command line parameters.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>Samual Murray: his "Start Using OmegaT in 5 Minutes!", that
        served some time ago as the starting point for the "Instant Start
        Guide" chapter, deserves a honorable mention here.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>Last but not least: my thanks to all the contributors to the
        OmegaT documentation tracker (<ulink
        url="???">http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=68187&amp;atid=912617</ulink>)
        for all the inconsistencies found in the previous versions of the
        documentation. Keep up your good work!</para>

  You need to have OpenOffice.org installed to read "OmegaT developer's guide.odt"

  OmegaT.vpp is a "Visual Paradigm for UML"(http://www.visual-paradigm.com) file.
It is used only to draw UML diagrams. You don't need to have "Visual Paradigm
for UML" if you want just to read documentation. All diagrams are stored in "OmegaT
developer's guide.odt" as pictures. If you need to edit diagrams, you can use
the free "Community Edition" of "Visual Paradigm for UML".
